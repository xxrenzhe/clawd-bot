## Additional Notes

Moltbot workflows work best when you keep inputs tight and outputs measurable.
Define success criteria for ai automation trends in 2026: what moltbot users should know before you automate anything significant.

For teams, document configuration changes and run clawdbot doctor after major edits.
This keeps the gateway stable and reduces debugging time when scaling up.

Key reminders:
- Keep tokens and passwords out of version control.
- Validate the gateway locally before exposing it.
- Roll out new skills in small batches and monitor logs.
- Re-check allow-lists after any channel changes.
