# AI Automation Workflows with Moltbot: Practical Examples

![AI automation workflows with Moltbot](/images/articles/ai-automation-workflows-with-moltbot-practical-examples.jpg)

## Introduction

AI automation works best when it is concrete. Instead of chasing every new model, focus on workflows that remove daily friction: triaging messages, turning notes into briefs, and running repeatable tasks on a schedule. Moltbot (also known as Clawdbot/Openclaw) is a self-hosted AI gateway built for these kinds of workflows, giving you data control and predictable cost.

In this tutorial, you will set up a working Moltbot gateway and implement three practical workflows. Each example is intentionally small so you can ship it quickly and expand it later.

## Quick setup (verified commands)

Use the official installer and onboarding flow to get a working gateway:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://clawd.bot/install.sh | bash
clawdbot onboard
clawdbot health
clawdbot gateway --port 18789 --verbose
```

Once the gateway is running, you can integrate the assistant with messaging apps or run local workflows. If you want a broader walkthrough, see [getting started](/articles/getting-started-with-moltbot-beginner-friendly-tutorial).

## Workflow 1: Inbox triage for fast replies

**Goal:** reduce the time spent sorting and responding to messages.

**Inputs:** email or chat messages, basic tags, and a response template.

**Output:** a short summary, a suggested reply, and a priority label.

A simple triage loop looks like this:

1. Capture incoming messages into a queue.
2. Ask Moltbot to summarize and classify each item.
3. Send the summary and draft reply back to your preferred channel.

**Tips to make it reliable:**

- Keep the labels limited (urgent, follow-up, reference).
- Use a small template for the reply format.
- Review the first 10 outputs before trusting the automation.

For deeper guidance, pair this with [task automation](/articles/clawdbot-task-automation) and [workflow optimization](/articles/clawdbot-workflow-optimization).

## Workflow 2: Research briefs from scattered notes

**Goal:** turn a messy set of links and notes into a clean brief.

**Inputs:** URLs, meeting notes, or clipped snippets.

**Output:** a structured brief with bullets, risks, and open questions.

A practical brief template:

- Summary in 3-5 bullets
- Key sources and citations
- Risks or uncertainties
- Next steps and owners

If you are using retrieval, integrate [RAG implementation](/articles/clawdbot-rag-implementation) to keep the summary grounded. This reduces hallucinations and makes the brief easier to trust.

## Workflow 3: Local LLM automation for recurring tasks

**Goal:** reduce API cost and improve privacy for repeatable tasks.

**Inputs:** stable prompts, recurring files, or scheduled jobs.

**Output:** deterministic summaries, checklists, or reports.

Local models are great for:

- Daily summaries
- Weekly checklists
- Formatting and cleanup
- Low-stakes drafts

When you need higher accuracy or advanced reasoning, you can route only those tasks to a premium API. This hybrid approach often delivers the best ROI. See [running local LLMs](/articles/running-local-llms-with-moltbot-ollama-and-open-source-model) for deeper setup guidance.

## Workflow templates you can reuse

Reusable templates make automation easier to scale. Instead of writing a new prompt for every task, define a template that describes the input, the guardrails, and the output format. A good template should be short enough to review quickly and strict enough to keep outputs consistent.

Use this simple structure when you design a workflow:

- **Inputs**: what fields or files are required.
- **Guardrails**: what the assistant must avoid or ignore.
- **Output format**: a bullet list, table, or JSON-like structure.
- **Escalation**: when to route the task back to a human.

This approach keeps workflows predictable and makes it easier to track ROI over time.

## Workflow selection checklist

Before automating a task, confirm it meets these criteria:

- The input is consistent and easy to describe.
- The output has a clear definition of done.
- You can verify quality quickly.
- The task happens at least weekly.

If a task fails any of these checks, keep it manual until the inputs are clearer. This keeps automation reliable and prevents frustration.

## Security and privacy considerations

Because Moltbot is self-hosted, you control the security model. Start with these best practices:

- Bind the gateway to loopback to avoid public exposure.
- Use pairing for messaging integrations.
- Store API keys as secrets and rotate them regularly.
- Put reverse proxies behind proper authentication.

For more detail, see [security best practices](/articles/clawdbot-security-best-practices) and [network setup](/articles/clawdbot-network-setup).

## Troubleshooting quick hits

| Issue | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Gateway not responding | Port conflict | Change the port or stop the conflicting service |
| Commands fail | Old Node.js | Upgrade to Node.js 22+ |
| Output quality low | Prompts too vague | Add examples and tighten the prompt format |

## Conclusion

AI automation pays off when it is focused and repeatable. Start with one of the workflows above, measure time saved, and expand only after it feels reliable. Moltbot gives you the privacy and flexibility to build workflows that keep paying back over time.
