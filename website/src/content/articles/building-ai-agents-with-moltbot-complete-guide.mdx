**Crafting a Definitive Guide to Moltbot-Powered AI Agents**

Okay, so I'm diving into this "Building AI Agents with Moltbot: Complete Guide" project. It's targeted at an "Advanced" technical audience, and the goal is a professional, approachable, and SEO-optimized piece, between 1500 and 2500 words. My task is to produce a really solid guide to Moltbot, which is also known as Clawdbot and Openclaw, an open-source, self-hosted AI gateway.

First, I'm making sure I nail the structure. Frontmatter is the immediate start, obviously using the specified keys. I need to strategically place those `HostingCTA` components throughout the article. I will mention the free installation service to offer extra value.

The core of the article is:
*   *Introduction:* I'll start with the evolution of AI, from chat to AI agency. I'll clearly introduce Moltbot (Openclaw/Clawdbot) as an AI gateway.
*   *Why Moltbot?* The focus has to be on self-hosting, user privacy, and flexibility in using any LLM (Claude, GPT-4, Ollama).
*   *Architecture:* I'm going to explain the gateway itself, how it connects to the LLMs, and how the persistence layer works.
*   *Getting Started (Installation):* I'm going to walk through a quick install, onboarding, and health check. Crucially, I'm using the verified commands in this section: `curl -fsSL https://clawd.bot/install.sh | bash` and `clawdbot onboard`.
*   *Core Concepts:* Messages, Channels, Skills, and Plugins are all key.
*   *Building Your First Agent:* Step-by-step instructions.
*   *Advanced Agent Workflows:* This is where I'll delve into multi-platform integration (Telegram/Discord), and memory management.
*   *Security:* This is really important. I need to cover bindings, pairing mode, authentication, proxies, and sandboxing in detail.
*   *Case Study/Example:* I'm thinking of creating an example of an autonomous research agent.
*   *Conclusion:* I'll end with the future of open-source AI agents.

Throughout the guide, I will weave in SEO keywords like "autonomous ai," "agent workflows," and the Moltbot name (along with Openclaw and Clawdbot), of course. The hook needs to be, "AI is becoming a teammate, not just a text box." I'm making sure to distinguish Moltbot as an "AI Gateway." I will include code blocks, YAML or configuration snippets, for things like `gateway.bind`, `gateway.auth.password`, etc.

I need to make sure I am hitting that word count, so I will expand on configuration, security architecture, and plugin development, but only to make sure the information is useful.

The article needs to be "Advanced" but accessible. This will all be in MDX format and no meta-commentary, right to the point. The frontmatter, the commands, the CTAs, and the free installation service all need to be there. I will focus on the "Gateway" concept.

I will structure the information into sections:
*   *Section 1:* The Agentic Shift (Why move past chatbots?)
*   *Section 2:* Installation and Setup (Using the script).
*   *Section 3:* Security (Loopback Binding, why SSRF is blocked, authorization).
*   *Section 4:* Extensibility (How to add skills, plugins).
*   *Section 5:* Deployment (Port 18789, hosting the gateway).

I need to make sure to explain *why* loopback binding is crucial (preventing SSRF and unauthorized external API calls) in the security section. I'll need to explain how the gateway translates messaging app events (Telegram/Discord) into prompts for the LLM in the advanced workflow section.

I'll be using "Moltbot" specific branding, using the terminology Clawdbot/Openclaw.
