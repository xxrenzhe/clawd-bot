**My Plan for Crafting an MDX Article on Moltbot (Clawdbot/Openclaw)**

Okay, here's the game plan. I'm taking on this MDX article on Moltbot, and I'm aiming for an "Intermediate" audience. That means I need to strike a balance between professional rigor and approachability. The goal is a meaty 1500-2500 words, demonstrating how Moltbot enables intelligent workflows, so I need to make sure I cover all key aspects.

First, the core of the piece will revolve around Moltbot as a self-hosted AI gateway. It's got to highlight that it supports Claude, GPT-4, and Ollama, and integrate with messaging platforms like Telegram, Discord, Slack, and WhatsApp. I need to make sure I make it clear that the most compelling features are persistent memory, skills/plugins, and proactive automation. I'll include the install command (`curl -fsSL https://clawd.bot/install.sh | bash`) right away and link to the GitHub repo. Security is going to be paramount, so loopback binding, pairing mode, and auth passwords will be highlighted.

The structure of the article is non-negotiable: a strict frontmatter structure, specific imports, and CTAs (hosting) at set points. I'll be clear to not include meta-commentary.

The content will follow this outline:

*   **Introduction:** Hook the reader by discussing AI's evolution from simple chat to sophisticated workflows.
*   **What is Moltbot (Clawdbot/Openclaw)?** I'll be explaining the "Openclaw" ecosystem and the significance of self-hosting.
*   **Installation & Initial Setup:** This section will include validated commands (`curl`, `onboard`, `health`).
*   **Architecture: Gateway and Messaging:** I will be diving into how the gateway connects to the messaging platforms.
*   **Core Concept: Designing Intelligent Workflows:** This is where I can really shine, showing how Moltbot allows users to build intelligent automated workflows.
*   **Step-by-Step Guide: Building a custom workflow:** I will be including examples such as news aggregation or a research assistant.
*   **Security & Best Practices:** Crucial for the audience, covering trusted proxies and sandboxing.
*   **Advanced Automation (Skills & Plugins):** I'll need to go deep here.
*   **Conclusion**

Specifically:

*   I'll make sure the *Frontmatter* includes all the essential metadata.
*   The *Introduction* will be a compelling hook.
*   The *HostingCTA (setup)* goes here.
*   In the *What is Moltbot?* section, I'll explain the "Openclaw" ecosystem and emphasize the self-hosting benefit.
*   I'll demonstrate installation with those crucial `curl` and other commands, and highlight the gateway configuration. I'll be detailing `gateway.bind` and `loopback`.
*   The *Workflows* section will show how to connect Claude/GPT-4 (and others) to local skills using code blocks with clear config examples.
*   Another *HostingCTA (inline)* will be inserted here.
*   I'll delve into *Advanced Features* like file-based memory and proactive automation.
*   *Security* is key, so that will be discussed.
*   I'll include *Real-world examples* using Python snippets or JSON configurations.
*   I need to be sure to *Mention free installation service* with a link.
*   The *Conclusion* will be a solid wrap-up.
*   One last *HostingCTA (conclusion)*, just to be safe.

I'll be mindful of the keywords: "ai workflows", "intelligent automation", "openclaw", and "clawdbot". The tone is professional but accessible. I will expand on the "Skills" and "Workflows" sections to achieve the word count, diving into how persistent memory and the gateway work. Code blocks will be syntax highlighted with bash, yaml, and json.

My initial thought to focus just on Claude was wrong - the prompt specifies the multi-LLM nature of the gateway. Consistency in naming (Moltbot/Clawdbot/Openclaw) is essential.

I'm thinking of creating a GitHub PR Reviewer or a Personal Knowledge Base workflow as a real-world example. Security will also be an essential topic, emphasizing `gateway.auth.password` and `pairing` mode.

Right, time to get started.
