## Claude API Key (Recommended)

Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot) works best with Claude. Here's how to get your key.

### Step 1: Create Account

1. Go to [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com)
2. Sign up with email or Google
3. Verify your email

### Step 2: Add Payment Method

1. Click "Settings" → "Billing"
2. Add a credit card (required even for free tier)
3. You get $5 free credit on signup

### Step 3: Get API Key

1. Click "API Keys" in the sidebar
2. Click "Create Key"
3. Name it (e.g., "Moltbot")
4. Copy the key (starts with `sk-ant-`)

**Important:** You can only see the key once. Store it securely.

### Step 4: Add to Moltbot

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-api03-..."
```

Add to your shell profile for persistence:

**Mac/Linux (zsh):**
```bash
echo 'export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

**Linux (bash):**
```bash
echo 'export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

## OpenAI API Key (Alternative)

### Get Key

1. Go to [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com)
2. Sign up and add payment method
3. Click "API Keys" → "Create new secret key"
4. Copy the key (starts with `sk-`)

### Add to Moltbot

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
```

### Configure Moltbot for OpenAI

During `moltbot onboard`, choose OpenAI as your provider. Or edit config:

```bash
nano ~/.moltbot/moltbot.json
```

```json
{
  "provider": "openai",
  "model": "gpt-4o"
}
```

## Google Gemini API Key

### Get Key

1. Go to [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com)
2. Click "Get API Key"
3. Create a key for your project
4. Copy the key

### Add to Moltbot

```bash
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="AIza..."
```

Configure:
```json
{
  "provider": "google",
  "model": "gemini-1.5-pro"
}
```

## Local Models (Free)

Use local models with Ollama for complete privacy and no API costs.

### Install Ollama

```bash
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
ollama pull llama3
```

### Configure Moltbot

```json
{
  "provider": "ollama",
  "model": "llama3",
  "ollama": {
    "baseUrl": "http://localhost:11434"
  }
}
```

No API key needed for local models.

## Multiple Providers

Configure multiple providers and switch between them:

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "anthropic": {
      "enabled": true,
      "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
    },
    "openai": {
      "enabled": true,
      "model": "gpt-4o"
    }
  },
  "defaultProvider": "anthropic"
}
```

Switch via command:
```bash
moltbot config set provider openai
```

## Security Best Practices

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Store in environment variables | Commit to git |
| Use separate keys for dev/prod | Share keys |
| Rotate keys periodically | Log keys |
| Set spending limits | Use in client-side code |

### Set Spending Limits

**Anthropic:** Console → Settings → Limits → Set monthly limit

**OpenAI:** Platform → Settings → Limits → Set hard/soft limits

## Verify Configuration

```bash
moltbot doctor
```

Expected output:
```
✓ ANTHROPIC_API_KEY set
✓ API key format valid
✓ API connection successful
```

Test with a message:
```bash
moltbot chat
> Hello, are you working?
```

## Cost Estimates

| Usage Level | Monthly Messages | Estimated Cost |
|-------------|------------------|----------------|
| Light | 50/day | $5-10 |
| Moderate | 200/day | $15-30 |
| Heavy | 500/day | $40-80 |

*Based on average conversation length of 2000 tokens*

## Troubleshooting

| Error | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| `Invalid API key` | Check for typos, regenerate key |
| `Rate limited` | Wait or upgrade tier |
| `Insufficient quota` | Add payment method or credits |
| `Connection refused` | Check network, try `curl api.anthropic.com` |

**Test API key directly:**
```bash
curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages \
  -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022","max_tokens":10,"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hi"}]}'
```

## Introduction

Moltbot API Keys: Claude, OpenAI, Gemini Setup matters because it shapes how teams design reliable AI workflows and measure outcomes.
This guide explains the essentials and shows how Moltbot users can apply the ideas in a repeatable way.
You will get a clear path from prerequisites to practical steps, with examples, safeguards, and next steps.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| Node.js | 22+ (check: node --version) |
| OS | macOS, Linux, Windows (via WSL2) |
| Memory | 2GB RAM minimum (4GB+ recommended for browser automation) |
| Storage | 500MB for installation |

If you are already running Moltbot, you can skip installation and focus on configuration and workflows.

## Additional Notes

Moltbot workflows work best when you keep inputs tight and outputs measurable.
Define success criteria for moltbot api keys: claude, openai, gemini setup before you automate anything significant.

For teams, document configuration changes and run clawdbot doctor after major edits.
This keeps the gateway stable and reduces debugging time when scaling up.

Key reminders:
- Keep tokens and passwords out of version control.
- Validate the gateway locally before exposing it.
- Roll out new skills in small batches and monitor logs.
- Re-check allow-lists after any channel changes.
