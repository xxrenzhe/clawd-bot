| Memory/History | `~/.moltbot/memory/` | High |
| Custom Skills | `~/.moltbot/skills/` | High |
| Cache | `~/.moltbot/cache/` | Low |

<HostingCTA context="setup" />

## Quick Backup (One Command)

```bash
moltbot backup create
```

```

<HostingCTA context="inline" />

## Manual Backup

### Full Backup Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# backup-moltbot.sh

BACKUP_DIR="/path/to/backups"
DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
BACKUP_FILE="$BACKUP_DIR/moltbot-$DATE.tar.gz"

# Stop gateway for consistency (optional)
moltbot gateway stop

# Create backup
tar -czf "$BACKUP_FILE" \
  ~/.moltbot/moltbot.json \
  ~/.moltbot/memory/ \
  ~/.moltbot/skills/ \
  --exclude='*.log' \
  --exclude='cache/'

# Restart gateway
moltbot gateway start

echo "Backup created: $BACKUP_FILE"
echo "Size: $(du -h $BACKUP_FILE | cut -f1)"
```

### Configuration Only

```bash
# Just config (small, fast)
cp ~/.moltbot/moltbot.json ~/backups/moltbot-config-$(date +%Y%m%d).json
```

### Memory/Conversations

```bash
# Conversation history
tar -czf ~/backups/moltbot-memory-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz ~/.moltbot/memory/
```

## Automated Backups

### Daily Cron Job

```bash
# Edit crontab
crontab -e

# Add daily backup at 3 AM
0 3 * * * /path/to/backup-moltbot.sh
```

### Backup with Rotation

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# backup-with-rotation.sh

BACKUP_DIR="/backups/moltbot"
KEEP_DAYS=30

# Create backup
tar -czf "$BACKUP_DIR/moltbot-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz" ~/.moltbot/

# Delete backups older than 30 days
find "$BACKUP_DIR" -name "moltbot-*.tar.gz" -mtime +$KEEP_DAYS -delete

echo "Backup complete. Kept last $KEEP_DAYS days."
```

### Backup to Cloud

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# backup-to-s3.sh

BACKUP_FILE="/tmp/moltbot-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz"

# Create local backup
tar -czf "$BACKUP_FILE" ~/.moltbot/

# Upload to S3
aws s3 cp "$BACKUP_FILE" s3://your-bucket/moltbot-backups/

# Upload to B2 (alternative)
# b2 upload-file your-bucket "$BACKUP_FILE" "moltbot-backups/"

# Clean up local
rm "$BACKUP_FILE"
```

## Restore Procedures

### From Backup File

```bash
# 1. Stop the gateway
moltbot gateway stop

# 2. Backup current state (just in case)
mv ~/.moltbot ~/.moltbot.old

# 3. Extract backup
mkdir ~/.moltbot
tar -xzf moltbot-2026-01-28.tar.gz -C ~/

# 4. Verify configuration
moltbot doctor

# 5. Start gateway
moltbot gateway start
```

### Selective Restore

```bash
# Restore only configuration
tar -xzf backup.tar.gz --strip-components=1 -C ~/.moltbot/ './moltbot.json'

# Restore only memory
tar -xzf backup.tar.gz --strip-components=1 -C ~/.moltbot/ './memory/'

# Restore only skills
tar -xzf backup.tar.gz --strip-components=1 -C ~/.moltbot/ './skills/'
```

## Migration to New Machine

### On Old Machine

```bash
# 1. Create full backup
moltbot backup create --output moltbot-migration.tar.gz

# 2. Export API keys (manually save these)
moltbot config get providers

# 3. Copy to new machine
scp moltbot-migration.tar.gz user@new-machine:~/
```

### On New Machine

```bash
# 1. Install Moltbot
curl -fsSL https://molt.bot/install.sh | bash

# 2. Restore backup
moltbot backup restore ~/moltbot-migration.tar.gz

# 3. Set API keys
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key"
export TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="your-token"

# 4. Verify
moltbot doctor
moltbot health

# 5. Start
moltbot gateway start
```

## Docker Backup

### Backup Docker Volume

```bash
# Stop container
docker-compose stop moltbot

# Backup data volume
docker run --rm \
  -v moltbot_data:/data \
  -v $(pwd):/backup \
  alpine tar -czf /backup/moltbot-data.tar.gz /data

# Backup config
cp docker-compose.yml moltbot.json .env backup/

# Restart
docker-compose start moltbot
```

### Restore Docker Volume

```bash
# Stop and remove container
docker-compose down

# Restore volume
docker run --rm \
  -v moltbot_data:/data \
  -v $(pwd):/backup \
  alpine sh -c "rm -rf /data/* && tar -xzf /backup/moltbot-data.tar.gz -C /"

# Start fresh
docker-compose up -d
```

## Verify Backup Integrity

```bash
# List contents without extracting
tar -tzf moltbot-backup.tar.gz

# Check for required files
tar -tzf moltbot-backup.tar.gz | grep -E "(moltbot.json|memory/|skills/)"

# Test extraction to temp dir
mkdir /tmp/test-restore
tar -xzf moltbot-backup.tar.gz -C /tmp/test-restore
ls -la /tmp/test-restore
rm -rf /tmp/test-restore
```

## Backup Best Practices

| Practice | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------|
| Frequency | Daily for active use |
| Location | Off-site (cloud, different machine) |
| Encryption | Use GPG for sensitive data |
| Testing | Monthly restore test |
| Retention | 30 days rolling + monthly archives |

### Encrypted Backup

```bash
# Create encrypted backup
tar -czf - ~/.moltbot/ | gpg --symmetric --cipher-algo AES256 > moltbot-backup.tar.gz.gpg

# Restore encrypted backup
gpg --decrypt moltbot-backup.tar.gz.gpg | tar -xzf - -C ~/
```

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Backup too large | Exclude cache: `--exclude='cache/'` |
| Permission errors | Run with sudo or fix ownership |
| Restore fails | Check backup integrity, extract to temp first |
| Missing memory | Verify backup included `memory/` directory |

### Check Backup Size

```bash
# See what's taking space
du -sh ~/.moltbot/*

# Typical sizes:
# moltbot.json: < 1 KB
# memory/: 1-100 MB (depends on usage)
# skills/: 1-10 MB
# cache/: 10-500 MB (safe to exclude)
```

## Introduction

Moltbot Backup & Restore: Never Lose Your Data matters because it shapes how teams design reliable AI workflows and measure outcomes.
This guide explains the essentials and shows how Moltbot users can apply the ideas in a repeatable way.
You will get a clear path from prerequisites to practical steps, with examples, safeguards, and next steps.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| Node.js | 22+ (check: node --version) |
| OS | macOS, Linux, Windows (via WSL2) |
| Memory | 2GB RAM minimum (4GB+ recommended for browser automation) |
| Storage | 500MB for installation |

If you are already running Moltbot, you can skip installation and focus on configuration and workflows.

## How to apply this topic

> ⚠️ Review install scripts before running them in production. Avoid committing API keys or secrets to version control.

1. Install and onboard if you are new to the platform.
```bash
curl -fsSL https://clawd.bot/install.sh | bash
clawdbot onboard
clawdbot health
```

2. Start the gateway and confirm it is reachable locally.
```bash
clawdbot gateway --port 18789 --verbose
```

3. Connect one messaging channel and run a small workflow end-to-end.
Keep the scope small, measure latency, and expand only after you confirm stable behavior.

## Additional Notes

Moltbot workflows work best when you keep inputs tight and outputs measurable.
Define success criteria for moltbot backup & restore: never lose your data before you automate anything significant.

For teams, document configuration changes and run clawdbot doctor after major edits.
This keeps the gateway stable and reduces debugging time when scaling up.

Key reminders:
- Keep tokens and passwords out of version control.
- Validate the gateway locally before exposing it.
- Roll out new skills in small batches and monitor logs.
- Re-check allow-lists after any channel changes.
