## Review a Pull Request

### Via Chat

```
You: Review PR #123 in myorg/myrepo

Moltbot: 📋 PR #123: Add user authentication

Summary:
This PR implements JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens.

✅ Strengths:
- Proper token validation
- Secure password hashing with bcrypt
- Rate limiting on login endpoint

⚠️ Concerns:
1. src/auth.js:45 - Token expiry too long (7 days)
   Recommendation: Use 15-minute access tokens with refresh

2. src/middleware.js:12 - Missing error handling
   The JWT verification could throw unhandled exceptions

3. Missing tests for token refresh flow

Security: No critical issues found
Complexity: 2 functions exceed threshold (score > 15)
```

### Via GitHub Integration

```bash
# Configure GitHub integration
moltbot configure --section skills.code-review.github
```

```json
{
  "skills": {
    "code-review": {
      "github": {
        "autoReview": true,
        "triggerOn": ["opened", "synchronize"],
        "postComments": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Review Configuration

### Custom Rules

```json
{
  "skills": {
    "code-review": {
      "rules": {
        "maxFunctionLength": 50,
        "maxComplexity": 10,
        "requireTests": true,
        "securityPatterns": [
          "eval\\(",
          "innerHTML",
          "dangerouslySetInnerHTML"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Language-Specific Rules

```json
{
  "skills": {
    "code-review": {
      "languages": {
        "javascript": {
          "linter": "eslint",
          "config": ".eslintrc.js"
        },
        "python": {
          "linter": "flake8",
          "config": ".flake8"
        },
        "go": {
          "linter": "golangci-lint",
          "config": ".golangci.yml"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Review Workflow

### Manual Review Request

```
You: Review this code for security issues:

\`\`\`javascript
app.get('/user/:id', (req, res) => {
  const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${req.params.id}`;
  db.query(query, (err, result) => {
    res.json(result);
  });
});
\`\`\`

Moltbot: 🚨 Critical Security Issue: SQL Injection

The code directly interpolates user input into a SQL query,
allowing attackers to execute arbitrary SQL.

Vulnerable line:
\`const query = \`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${req.params.id}\`;\`

Fix:
\`\`\`javascript
app.get('/user/:id', (req, res) => {
  const query = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?';
  db.query(query, [req.params.id], (err, result) => {
    res.json(result);
  });
});
\`\`\`

Always use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
```

## Review Templates

### Security-Focused Review

```
You: Security review PR #456

Moltbot: 🔒 Security Review for PR #456

Authentication:
├─ ✅ JWT validation present
├─ ⚠️ Token not invalidated on logout
└─ ⚠️ No rate limiting on auth endpoints

Input Validation:
├─ ✅ Email validation
├─ 🚨 Missing sanitization on username
└─ ⚠️ No file type validation on uploads

Dependencies:
├─ 🚨 lodash@4.17.15 - Prototype pollution (CVE-2020-8203)
└─ ⚠️ express@4.17.1 - Update recommended

Recommendations:
1. Add rate limiting: express-rate-limit
2. Sanitize inputs: validator.js or DOMPurify
3. Update vulnerable dependencies
```

### Performance Review

```
You: Review this code for performance

Moltbot: ⚡ Performance Analysis

Issues:
1. N+1 Query Problem (users.js:34)
   Loading related data in a loop causes 100+ queries
   Fix: Use eager loading with JOIN

2. Missing Index (users.js:56)
   Query on 'email' field without index
   Fix: ALTER TABLE users ADD INDEX idx_email (email)

3. Synchronous File Operations (upload.js:12)
   Using fs.readFileSync blocks event loop
   Fix: Use fs.promises.readFile

4. Memory Leak (cache.js:89)
   Cache grows unbounded
   Fix: Add maxSize and TTL to cache

Estimated Impact:
- Query optimization: 80% faster list queries
- Async file ops: 40% better throughput
```

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Review times out | Reduce file count or split PR |
| Missing context | Include related files in review |
| False positives | Adjust rules in config |
| No GitHub comments | Check webhook configuration |

### Debug Mode

```bash
# Verbose review output
moltbot review --verbose --pr myorg/repo#123

# Test configuration

## Introduction

Moltbot Code Review: AI-Powered PR Analysis matters because it shapes how teams design reliable AI workflows and measure outcomes.
This guide explains the essentials and shows how Moltbot users can apply the ideas in a repeatable way.
You will get a clear path from prerequisites to practical steps, with examples, safeguards, and next steps.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| Node.js | 22+ (check: node --version) |
| OS | macOS, Linux, Windows (via WSL2) |
| Memory | 2GB RAM minimum (4GB+ recommended for browser automation) |
| Storage | 500MB for installation |

If you are already running Moltbot, you can skip installation and focus on configuration and workflows.

## How to apply this topic

> ⚠️ Review install scripts before running them in production. Avoid committing API keys or secrets to version control.

1. Install and onboard if you are new to the platform.
```bash
curl -fsSL https://clawd.bot/install.sh | bash
clawdbot onboard
clawdbot health
```

2. Start the gateway and confirm it is reachable locally.
```bash
clawdbot gateway --port 18789 --verbose
```

3. Connect one messaging channel and run a small workflow end-to-end.
Keep the scope small, measure latency, and expand only after you confirm stable behavior.

## Additional Notes

Moltbot workflows work best when you keep inputs tight and outputs measurable.
Define success criteria for moltbot code review: ai-powered pr analysis before you automate anything significant.

For teams, document configuration changes and run clawdbot doctor after major edits.
This keeps the gateway stable and reduces debugging time when scaling up.

Key reminders:
- Keep tokens and passwords out of version control.
- Validate the gateway locally before exposing it.
- Roll out new skills in small batches and monitor logs.
- Re-check allow-lists after any channel changes.
