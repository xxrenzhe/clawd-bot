         ## Why Start Now?

### SEO-Optimized Content

```
You: Write an SEO article targeting "best project management
     software for small teams" - include comparison table,
     focus on 2026 options.

Moltbot: **Best Project Management Software for Small Teams (2026)**

         *Looking for project management tools that won't
         overwhelm your 5-person team? Here are the top
         picks for 2026, tested and compared.*

         ## Quick Comparison

         | Tool | Price/user | Best For |
         |------|------------|----------|
         | Linear | $8 | Dev teams |
         | Notion | $10 | All-in-one |
         | Asana | $11 | Marketing |
         | Monday | $12 | Visual teams |
         | ClickUp | $7 | Budget-conscious |

         ## What Small Teams Actually Need

         Forget enterprise features. Teams under 10 need:
         - Quick onboarding (< 1 hour)
         - Mobile apps that actually work
         - Affordable per-seat pricing
         - Integrations with Slack/Teams

         ## Our Top Pick: Linear

         Why: Built for speed. No feature bloat.
         Interface feels like a native app.
         ...

## Social Media Content

### Twitter/X Threads

```
You: Create a Twitter thread about the benefits of
     learning to code in 2026

Moltbot: Here's a 7-tweet thread:

         1/ Learning to code in 2026 isn't about becoming
            a software engineer.

            It's about understanding the language that
            runs everything around you.

            Here's why it matters more than ever 🧵

         2/ AI won't replace coders.

            But coders who use AI will replace those who don't.

            Learning code = learning how to direct AI tools
            effectively.

         3/ The job market shifted.

            2024: "We need developers"
            2026: "We need people who can talk to developers"

            Even PMs, marketers, and designers benefit from
            code literacy.

         4/ You don't need a CS degree.

            - freeCodeCamp: Free, comprehensive
            - The Odin Project: Full-stack path
            - Codecademy: Interactive learning
            - YouTube: Literally everything

            Total cost: $0

         5/ Start with JavaScript or Python.

            JavaScript: Build websites, apps, automation
            Python: Data, AI, scripting

            Pick one. Stick with it for 6 months.

         6/ Build something real.

            - A personal website
            - A Discord bot
            - A Chrome extension
            - An automation script

            Portfolios > Certificates

         7/ The ROI is insane.

            3-6 months of learning →
            - Higher salary potential
            - Better job security
            - Side project income
            - Understand AI tools

            What are you waiting for?
```

### LinkedIn Posts

```
You: Write a LinkedIn post about our company reaching
     10,000 customers

Moltbot: We just hit 10,000 customers. 🎉

         But here's what nobody tells you about
         reaching this milestone:

         ➜ Customer #1 was my mom (she still uses it)
         ➜ Customer #100 found a bug that crashed everything
         ➜ Customer #1,000 wrote us the review that changed our marketing
         ➜ Customer #5,000 requested the feature that became our best seller

         The numbers are nice.
         The stories behind them are better.

         Thank you to everyone who took a chance on us
         when we were just two people and a Notion doc.

         What's next? 100,000. And we're hiring to get there.

## Email Copy

### Newsletter Drafts

```
You: Write a newsletter announcing our new AI features

Moltbot: Subject: We added AI (and it actually works)

         Hey {{first_name}},

         Three months ago, you asked for AI features.
         We said "we'll look into it."

         Today, it's live. Here's what you can do:

         ✅ Auto-summarize long documents
         ✅ Generate first drafts from outlines
         ✅ Smart search across all your files
         ✅ One-click translation (50+ languages)

         **How to try it:**
         1. Open any document
         2. Click the ✨ button (top right)
         3. Pick an action

         That's it. No setup. No API keys. No extra cost
         on your current plan.

         **What we didn't add:**
         - AI that writes entire documents for you
         - Hallucinated content without sources
         - Features that feel like demos

         We built tools that save you time on the boring
         stuff so you can focus on the creative work.

         Try it and let us know what you think.

         —The Team

         P.S. Reply to this email with feedback.
         I read every one.
```

### Cold Outreach

```
You: Write a cold email to potential customers who
     use competitor product X

Moltbot: Subject: Quick question about [X]

         Hi {{name}},

         Noticed you're using [X] for {{use_case}}.

         Curious: are you hitting the {{common_pain_point}}
         issue? We hear that a lot from teams switching over.

         We built {{product}} specifically for teams who
         outgrew [X]. The main difference:

         - {{Key differentiator 1}}
         - {{Key differentiator 2}}
         - {{Pricing advantage}}

         Would a 15-min demo be useful? I can show you
         how {{similar_company}} cut their {{metric}} by 40%.

         No pressure either way.

         Best,
         {{your_name}}

         ---

         Note: I've left placeholders for you to fill in.
         Want me to customize this for a specific competitor
         or use case?

    }
  }
}
```

### Tone Options

| Tone | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| `professional` | B2B content, LinkedIn |
| `casual` | Social media, blogs |
| `friendly` | Email newsletters |
| `technical` | Documentation, tutorials |
| `persuasive` | Sales copy, landing pages |

## Best Practices

1. **Be specific about audience** - "Write for CTOs" vs "Write for everyone"

2. **Specify format** - "Use bullet points" or "Include a table"

3. **Set length expectations** - "500 words" or "Twitter-length"

4. **Request iterations** - "Make it more casual" or "Shorten by 50%"

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Content too generic | Add more context about brand voice |
| Missing facts | Enable web search skill for research |
| Wrong tone | Specify tone in config or prompt |
| Too long/short | Specify word count explicitly |
