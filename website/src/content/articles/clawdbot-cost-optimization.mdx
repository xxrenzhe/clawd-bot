# Moltbot Cost Optimization: Save 50% on API Bills

![Moltbot Cost Optimization](/images/articles/clawdbot-cost-optimization.jpg)

## Cost Breakdown

| Component | Typical Cost | Can Optimize? |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|
| API tokens (input) | $3/1M tokens | Yes |
| API tokens (output) | $15/1M tokens | Yes |
| Infrastructure | $0-10/month | Yes |
| Moltbot software | Free | — |

Most costs are API tokens. This guide shows how to reduce them by 50% or more.

## Model Selection

The biggest cost factor is which model you use:

| Model | Input | Output | Speed | Quality |
|-------|-------|--------|-------|---------|
| Claude 3.5 Sonnet | $3 | $15 | Fast | Excellent |
| Claude 3 Haiku | $0.25 | $1.25 | Fastest | Good |
| GPT-4o | $5 | $15 | Fast | Excellent |
| GPT-4o-mini | $0.15 | $0.60 | Fastest | Good |
| Llama 3 (local) | Free | Free | Medium | Good |

**Strategy:** Use cheaper models for simple tasks, premium models for complex ones.

### Task-Based Model Routing

Configure different models for different tasks:

```json
{
  "models": {
    "default": "claude-3-5-sonnet",
    "routing": {
      "simple": {
        "model": "claude-3-haiku",
        "patterns": ["weather", "time", "reminders", "quick question"]
      },
      "complex": {
        "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet",
        "patterns": ["code review", "research", "analysis", "write"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Savings:** 60-80% on simple queries.

## Token Optimization

### 1. Shorter System Prompts

Every request includes your system prompt. Shorter = cheaper.

❌ Expensive (500 tokens):
```
You are a helpful AI assistant created to assist users with a wide variety of tasks. You should always be polite, professional, and thorough in your responses. When users ask questions, provide detailed answers that fully address their needs. If you're unsure about something, let the user know and suggest alternatives...
[continues for 500 more words]
```

✅ Cheaper (80 tokens):
```
You are a helpful personal assistant. Be concise. Use bullet points for lists. Ask clarifying questions for ambiguous requests.
```

**Savings:** 420 tokens × every request = significant over time.

### 2. Conversation Summarization

Long conversations cost more. Enable automatic summarization:

```json
{
  "memory": {
    "conversationSummary": {
      "enabled": true,
      "triggerTokens": 4000,
      "keepMessages": 10
    }
  }
}
```

After 4000 tokens, Moltbot summarizes older messages instead of including them verbatim.

**Savings:** 50%+ on long conversations.

### 3. Response Length Limits

Prevent unnecessarily long responses:

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "maxTokens": 500,
    "systemPrompt": "Be concise. Aim for 2-3 sentences unless more detail is explicitly requested."
  }
}
```

### 4. Caching Repeated Queries

Enable response caching for identical queries:

```json
{
  "cache": {
    "enabled": true,
    "ttl": 3600,
    "patterns": ["weather", "stock prices", "news"]
  }
}
```

"What's the weather?" at 9:00 AM → API call (costs money)
"What's the weather?" at 9:05 AM → Cached response (free)

**Savings:** 100% on repeated queries.

## Local Models (Free)

For maximum savings, use local models for suitable tasks:

### Install Ollama

```bash
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
ollama pull llama3
ollama pull mistral
```

### Configure Hybrid Approach

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "ollama": {
      "baseUrl": "http://localhost:11434",
      "models": ["llama3", "mistral"]
    },
    "anthropic": {
      "models": ["claude-3-5-sonnet"]
    }
  },
  "routing": {
    "local": {
      "provider": "ollama",
      "model": "llama3",
      "patterns": ["reminders", "quick questions", "translations"]
    },
    "cloud": {
      "provider": "anthropic",
      "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet",
      "patterns": ["code", "research", "complex analysis"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Savings:** 80-90% for tasks routed to local models.

## Skill-Based Optimization

Some skills don't need AI at all:

### Skip AI for Simple Skills

```json
{
  "skills": {
    "weather": {
      "directApi": true,
      "skipLlm": true
    },
    "timer": {
      "directApi": true,
      "skipLlm": true
    },
    "calculator": {
      "directApi": true,
      "skipLlm": true
    }
  }
}
```

"Set a timer for 5 minutes" → Skill handles directly, no API call.

## Monitoring Costs

### Daily Reports

```json
{
  "monitoring": {
    "dailyCostReport": {
      "enabled": true,
      "channel": "telegram",
      "time": "21:00"
    }
  }
}
```

Every evening:
```
📊 Daily API Usage Report

Tokens used: 45,230
├─ Input: 12,450
└─ Output: 32,780

Estimated cost: $0.52

By model:
├─ Claude 3.5 Sonnet: $0.45
└─ Claude 3 Haiku: $0.07

Top token consumers:
1. Code review (15,000 tokens)
2. Research task (12,000 tokens)
3. Email drafts (8,000 tokens)
```

### Set Spending Limits

```json
{
  "billing": {
    "dailyLimit": 5.00,
    "monthlyLimit": 100.00,
    "warningThreshold": 0.8
  }
}
```

At 80% of limit:
```
⚠️ Budget Warning: You've used $80 of your $100 monthly limit.
```

### Provider Spending Limits

Also set limits at the API provider level:
- **Anthropic:** Console → Settings → Limits
- **OpenAI:** Platform → Settings → Limits

## Real Cost Comparisons
