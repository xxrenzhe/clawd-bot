### Configure Auto-Responses

```json

      "autoRespond": true,
      "confidenceThreshold": 0.8,

    }
  }
}
```

Moltbot: To cancel your subscription:

         1. Go to **Settings** > **Billing**
         2. Click **Cancel Subscription**
         3. Confirm cancellation

         You'll keep access until the end of your
         current billing period (Feb 28, 2026).

         Is there anything specific that led to this?
         We'd love a chance to help before you go.

Customer: I can't log in, keeps saying wrong password

Moltbot: I'm sorry you're having trouble logging in.
         Let me help you get back in:

         **Try these steps:**
         1. Click "Forgot Password" on login page
         2. Check your email (including spam folder)
         3. Use the reset link within 1 hour

         **Still not working?**
         - Make sure you're using the right email
         - Try a different browser
         - Clear browser cache

         If none of these work, I'll connect you
         with our support team. Want me to do that?
```

## Ticket Routing

### Automatic Categorization

```json
{
  "skills": {
    "support": {
      "routing": {
        "billing": {
          "keywords": ["refund", "payment", "invoice", "cancel", "charge"],
          "team": "billing-team",
          "priority": "normal"
        },
        "technical": {
          "keywords": ["bug", "error", "crash", "not working", "broken"],
          "team": "engineering",
          "priority": "high"
        },
        "sales": {
          "keywords": ["pricing", "enterprise", "demo", "discount", "upgrade"],
          "team": "sales",
          "priority": "high"
        },
        "general": {
          "team": "support",
          "priority": "normal"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Routing in Action

```
Customer: The dashboard keeps crashing when I upload
          files larger than 10MB. Getting error code 503.

Moltbot: I've identified this as a technical issue and
         created a ticket for our engineering team.

         **Ticket #1234**
         Category: Technical
         Priority: High
         Team: Engineering

         While we investigate, try these workarounds:
         - Upload files under 10MB in batches
         - Use our desktop app for large uploads
         - Compress files before uploading

         You'll receive an email when we have an update.
         Average resolution time: 4-8 hours.

         Anything else I can help with?
```

## Smart Escalation

### Frustration Detection

```json
{
  "skills": {
    "support": {
      "escalation": {
        "triggerWords": ["frustrated", "angry", "unacceptable", "lawsuit", "cancel", "terrible"],
        "messageCount": 5,
        "repeatQuestion": 2,
        "action": "human_handoff"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Escalation in Action

```
Customer: I've asked 3 times and nobody is helping me!
          This is unacceptable. I want to speak to a manager.

Moltbot: I completely understand your frustration,
         and I apologize for the experience so far.

         I'm connecting you with Sarah from our
         senior support team right now.

         **While you wait (typically < 2 minutes):**
         - Your case has been marked as priority
         - All previous messages are included
         - Sarah has full authority to resolve this

         Is there anything specific you'd like me
         to flag for Sarah before she joins?

[Sarah joins the conversation]

Sarah: Hi, I'm Sarah. I've reviewed your case and
       I'm here to make this right. Let me...
```

## Multi-Channel Support

### Discord Server Support

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "discord": {
      "serverConfigs": {
        "your-community": {
          "supportChannel": "support",
          "autoRespond": true,
          "privateThreads": true,
          "tagOnEscalation": ["@support-team"]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Discord conversation:
```
User in #support: My API key isn't working, getting 401 errors

Moltbot: 🔧 Let me help troubleshoot your API key issue.

         **Common causes of 401 errors:**

         1. **Key not activated** - New keys take ~1 min
         2. **Wrong environment** - Test vs production
         3. **Key revoked** - Check dashboard status
         4. **Rate limited** - Check X-RateLimit headers

         Can you share:
         - When the key was created?
         - Which endpoint you're calling?
         - The full error response (redact the key)?

         I'll create a private thread for sensitive details.
```

### Email Support Integration

```json
{
  "skills": {
    "email": {
      "supportAddress": "support@company.com",
      "autoResponse": true,
      "ticketCreation": true,
      "replyTemplate": "support"
    }
  }
}
```

Auto-reply to support emails:
```
Subject: Re: Can't access my account

Hi {{customer_name}},

Thanks for reaching out. I've created ticket #5678
for your account access issue.

Based on your message, I recommend:

1. Try resetting your password at:
   https://app.company.com/reset

2. If that doesn't work, reply with:
   - The email you're trying to log in with
   - When you last accessed successfully
   - Any error messages you see

I'll respond within 2 hours during business hours
(9am-6pm EST, Mon-Fri).

Best,
Moltbot
Customer Support

## Additional Notes

Moltbot workflows work best when you keep inputs tight and outputs measurable.
Define success criteria for moltbot customer support: tickets, faqs, escalation before you automate anything significant.

For teams, document configuration changes and run clawdbot doctor after major edits.
This keeps the gateway stable and reduces debugging time when scaling up.

Key reminders:
- Keep tokens and passwords out of version control.
- Validate the gateway locally before exposing it.
- Roll out new skills in small batches and monitor logs.
- Re-check allow-lists after any channel changes.
