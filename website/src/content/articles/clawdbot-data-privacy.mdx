# Moltbot Data Privacy: Self-Hosted AI Security

![Moltbot Data Privacy](/images/articles/clawdbot-data-privacy.jpg)

## Privacy Overview

| Feature | Default | Privacy Mode |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| Conversation storage | Local | Local, encrypted |
| API logging | Minimal | Disabled |
| Telemetry | Opt-in | Disabled |
| Data retention | 30 days | Customizable |

<HostingCTA context="setup" />

## Self-Hosting Advantage

### Data Flow Comparison

**Cloud AI Assistant:**
```
You → Cloud Service → AI Provider → Cloud Service → You
         ↓
   Data stored on
   third-party servers
```

**Moltbot Self-Hosted:**
```
You → Your Server → AI Provider → Your Server → You
         ↓
   Data stored on
   your own hardware
```

## Privacy Configuration

### Enable Privacy Mode

```json
{
  "privacy": {
    "mode": "strict",
    "encryption": true,
    "telemetry": false,
    "logging": "minimal"
  }
}
```

### Data Retention

```json
{
  "privacy": {
    "retention": {
      "conversations": "7d",
      "logs": "1d",
      "cache": "1h"
    }
  }
}
```

## Local-Only Mode

### Use Local LLM

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "provider": "ollama",
    "model": "llama3:70b",
    "local": true
  }
}
```

With Ollama, data never leaves your machine:

```bash
# Install Ollama
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh

# Pull model
ollama pull llama3:70b

# Configure Moltbot
moltbot config set agent.provider ollama
moltbot config set agent.model llama3:70b
```

### Hybrid Mode

Use local LLM for sensitive tasks, cloud for others:

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "providers": {
      "default": {
        "provider": "anthropic",
        "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet"
      },
      "sensitive": {
        "provider": "ollama",
        "model": "llama3:70b"
      }
    },
    "routing": {
      "patterns": {
        "password|secret|private|confidential": "sensitive"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Encryption

### At-Rest Encryption

```json
{
  "privacy": {
    "encryption": {
      "enabled": true,
      "algorithm": "AES-256-GCM",
      "keyFile": "~/.moltbot/encryption.key"
    }
  }
}
```

Generate encryption key:
```bash
moltbot security generate-key
```

### Encrypt Specific Data

```json
{
  "privacy": {
    "encryption": {
      "encrypt": ["conversations", "memory", "credentials"],
      "exclude": ["logs", "cache"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Data Minimization

### Reduce Stored Data

```json
{
  "privacy": {
    "minimize": {
      "stripPII": true,
      "truncateMessages": 1000,
      "excludeAttachments": true
    }
  }
}
```

### Automatic PII Redaction

```json
{
  "privacy": {
    "pii": {
      "detect": true,
      "redact": true,
      "patterns": [
        "email",
        "phone",
        "ssn",
        "creditCard"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Example:
```
Stored: "Contact me at [EMAIL REDACTED]"
Original: "Contact me at john@example.com"
```

## GDPR Compliance

### Data Subject Rights

```bash
# Export user data
moltbot privacy export --user telegram:123456789 --output user-data.json

# Delete user data
moltbot privacy delete --user telegram:123456789

# Anonymize user data
moltbot privacy anonymize --user telegram:123456789
```

### Consent Management

```json
{
  "privacy": {
    "consent": {
      "required": true,
      "message": "By using this bot, you agree to data processing. Type /privacy for details.",
      "dataTypes": ["conversations", "preferences"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Data Processing Agreement

```json
{
  "privacy": {
    "dpa": {
      "processor": "Self-hosted",
      "purpose": "AI assistant services",
      "retention": "30 days",
      "subProcessors": ["anthropic.com"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Audit Logging

### Enable Privacy Audit Log

```json
{
  "privacy": {
    "audit": {
      "enabled": true,
      "events": [
        "data.access",
        "data.export",
        "data.delete",
        "consent.granted",
        "consent.withdrawn"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### View Audit Log

```bash
moltbot privacy audit --last 30d
```

Output:
```
📋 Privacy Audit Log

2026-01-28 14:30:00 | data.access | user:123456 | conversation sess_abc
2026-01-28 12:15:00 | data.export | admin | user:123456 exported
2026-01-27 09:00:00 | consent.granted | user:789012 | full access
```

| Disable telemetry | `moltbot config set privacy.telemetry false` |
| Set retention | `moltbot config set privacy.retention.conversations 7d` |
| Generate keys | `moltbot security generate-key` |

### Regular Maintenance

| Task | Frequency |
|------|-----------|

| Purge old data | Automatic |
| Rotate encryption keys | Yearly |
| Review access logs | Monthly |

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Encryption key lost | Data cannot be recovered; restore from backup |
| Slow performance with encryption | Use hardware acceleration (AES-NI) |
| PII still visible in logs | Check logging level, enable redaction |
| GDPR export failing | Ensure user ID format is correct |

### Verify Privacy Settings

```bash
moltbot doctor --privacy
```

Output:

## Introduction

Moltbot Privacy: 7 Rules to Keep Your Data Local matters because it shapes how teams design reliable AI workflows and measure outcomes.
This guide explains the essentials and shows how Moltbot users can apply the ideas in a repeatable way.
You will get a clear path from prerequisites to practical steps, with examples, safeguards, and next steps.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| Node.js | 22+ (check: node --version) |
| OS | macOS, Linux, Windows (via WSL2) |
| Memory | 2GB RAM minimum (4GB+ recommended for browser automation) |
| Storage | 500MB for installation |

If you are already running Moltbot, you can skip installation and focus on configuration and workflows.

## How to apply this topic

> ⚠️ Review install scripts before running them in production. Avoid committing API keys or secrets to version control.

1. Install and onboard if you are new to the platform.
```bash
curl -fsSL https://clawd.bot/install.sh | bash
clawdbot onboard
clawdbot health
```

2. Start the gateway and confirm it is reachable locally.
```bash
clawdbot gateway --port 18789 --verbose
```

3. Connect one messaging channel and run a small workflow end-to-end.
Keep the scope small, measure latency, and expand only after you confirm stable behavior.

## Additional Notes

Moltbot workflows work best when you keep inputs tight and outputs measurable.
Define success criteria for moltbot privacy: 7 rules to keep your data local before you automate anything significant.

For teams, document configuration changes and run clawdbot doctor after major edits.
This keeps the gateway stable and reduces debugging time when scaling up.

Key reminders:
- Keep tokens and passwords out of version control.
- Validate the gateway locally before exposing it.
- Roll out new skills in small batches and monitor logs.
- Re-check allow-lists after any channel changes.
