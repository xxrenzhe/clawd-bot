<HostingCTA context="setup" />

## Quick Start

```bash
# Document a file
moltbot document src/api/users.ts

# Document entire project
moltbot document ./src --recursive

# Generate README
moltbot readme --from-code
```

<HostingCTA context="inline" />

## Code Documentation

### Auto-Generate JSDoc

```bash
moltbot document src/utils.js --style jsdoc
```

Before:
```javascript
function calculateTax(amount, rate) {
  return amount * rate;
}
```

After:
```javascript
/**
 * Calculates tax amount based on base amount and tax rate.
 * @param {number} amount - The base amount to calculate tax on
 * @param {number} rate - The tax rate as a decimal (e.g., 0.08 for 8%)
 * @returns {number} The calculated tax amount
 * @example
 * calculateTax(100, 0.08) // Returns 8
 */
function calculateTax(amount, rate) {
  return amount * rate;
}
```

### Python Docstrings

```bash
moltbot document src/api.py --style google
```

Output:
```python
def process_order(order_id: str, items: list[Item]) -> OrderResult:
    """Process an order with the given items.

    Args:
        order_id: Unique identifier for the order.
        items: List of items to include in the order.

    Returns:
        OrderResult containing order status and confirmation.

    Raises:
        OrderError: If order validation fails.
        InventoryError: If items are out of stock.
    """
```

## API Documentation

### Generate OpenAPI Spec

```bash
moltbot api-docs src/routes --format openapi

          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: array
                items:
                  $ref: '#/components/schemas/User'

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Generate docs
        run: moltbot document src/ --output docs/
      - name: Deploy to Pages

## Interactive Documentation

### Chat-Based Queries

```
You: Document the UserService class
Moltbot: Generated documentation for UserService:

## UserService

Manages user authentication, profile updates, and session handling.

### Methods

#### authenticate(credentials)
Validates user credentials and creates a session.

#### updateProfile(userId, data)
Updates user profile information.

#### revokeSession(sessionId)
Invalidates an active session.
```

## Quality Checks

### Validate Documentation

```bash
moltbot docs check --coverage 80
```

Output:
```
📊 Documentation Coverage

src/api/users.ts: 95% ✅
src/api/orders.ts: 87% ✅
src/utils/helpers.ts: 45% ❌

Overall: 76% (target: 80%)

Missing:
- src/utils/helpers.ts:formatDate()
- src/utils/helpers.ts:parseQuery()
```

### Sync Check

```bash
moltbot docs sync-check
```

Detects outdated documentation that doesn't match code.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Missing types | No TypeScript | Use --infer-types |
| Wrong format | Bad config | Check style setting |
| Skipped files | Ignore patterns | Review ignore list |
| Incomplete docs | Private members | Use --include-private |

### Debug Mode

```bash
moltbot document src/ --verbose
```

## Introduction

Moltbot Documentation: AI-Powered Docs Generator matters because it shapes how teams design reliable AI workflows and measure outcomes.
This guide explains the essentials and shows how Moltbot users can apply the ideas in a repeatable way.
You will get a clear path from prerequisites to practical steps, with examples, safeguards, and next steps.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| Node.js | 22+ (check: node --version) |
| OS | macOS, Linux, Windows (via WSL2) |
| Memory | 2GB RAM minimum (4GB+ recommended for browser automation) |
| Storage | 500MB for installation |

If you are already running Moltbot, you can skip installation and focus on configuration and workflows.

## How to apply this topic

> ⚠️ Review install scripts before running them in production. Avoid committing API keys or secrets to version control.

1. Install and onboard if you are new to the platform.
```bash
curl -fsSL https://clawd.bot/install.sh | bash
clawdbot onboard
clawdbot health
```

2. Start the gateway and confirm it is reachable locally.
```bash
clawdbot gateway --port 18789 --verbose
```

3. Connect one messaging channel and run a small workflow end-to-end.
Keep the scope small, measure latency, and expand only after you confirm stable behavior.

## Additional Notes

Moltbot workflows work best when you keep inputs tight and outputs measurable.
Define success criteria for moltbot documentation: ai-powered docs generator before you automate anything significant.

For teams, document configuration changes and run clawdbot doctor after major edits.
This keeps the gateway stable and reduces debugging time when scaling up.

Key reminders:
- Keep tokens and passwords out of version control.
- Validate the gateway locally before exposing it.
- Roll out new skills in small batches and monitor logs.
- Re-check allow-lists after any channel changes.
