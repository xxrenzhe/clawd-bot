         3. Oct 8 - You: Re: Q4 Budget Draft
            "Updated figures attached..."

         4. Oct 5 - Finance: Q4 Budget Planning
            "Starting the planning process..."
```

### Create New Email

         To: john@company.com
         Subject: Reschedule Our Meeting

         Hi John,

         Would it be possible to move our meeting to Friday?
         Please let me know what time works for you.

         Best,
         [Your name]

         ---
         Send now? [Yes/No]
```

### Schedule Send

```
You: Send this email tomorrow at 9am
Moltbot: Scheduled for delivery: Tomorrow, 9:00 AM EST
         The email will be sent automatically.
```

## Email Organization

### Auto-Archive

```
You: Archive all newsletters older than 30 days
Moltbot: Archived 47 emails:
         - 12 from Tech Digest
         - 8 from Product Hunt
         - 27 from various newsletters
```

### Label/Folder Management

```
You: Move all emails from Client X to the "Clients/X" folder
Moltbot: Moved 23 emails to Clients/X folder
```

### Bulk Actions

```
You: Mark all GitHub notifications as read
Moltbot: Marked 34 GitHub notification emails as read
```

## Morning Briefing

Set up automatic morning email summaries:

```json
{
  "automations": {
    "morning_briefing": {
      "time": "08:00",
      "tasks": ["email_summary", "calendar_today"],
      "channel": "telegram"
    }
  }
}
```

Every morning at 8am, you'll get:
```
Good morning! Here's your briefing:

📧 **Email:**
- 3 urgent emails need response
- 12 newsletters (auto-archived)
- 5 notifications

📅 **Today:**
- 10:00 Team standup
- 14:00 Client call
- 16:00 1:1 with manager
```

## Security Considerations

| Setting | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|
| Authentication | Use OAuth over app passwords |
| Email account | Consider dedicated account for AI |
| Permissions | Read-only initially, add send later |
| Sensitive emails | Configure exclusion patterns |

### Exclude Sensitive Emails

```json
{
  "skills": {
    "email": {
      "exclude": {
        "senders": ["hr@company.com", "legal@company.com"],
        "subjects": ["confidential", "personal"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Authentication failed" | Regenerate app password or re-run OAuth |
| "Rate limited" | Reduce request frequency |
| "Permission denied" | Check API scopes are granted |
| "Email not found" | Check search query, try broader terms |

**Test connection:**
```bash
moltbot skill test email
```

## Advanced: Custom Filters

Create custom email processing rules:

```json
{
  "skills": {
    "email": {
      "rules": [
        {
          "match": "from:boss@company.com",
          "action": "notify_urgent"
        },
        {
          "match": "subject:invoice",
          "action": "label:Finance"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
