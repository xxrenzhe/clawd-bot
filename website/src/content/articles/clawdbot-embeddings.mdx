## Vector Store Setup

### Built-in SQLite Store

```json
{
  "embeddings": {
    "store": {
      "type": "sqlite",
      "path": "~/.moltbot/vectors.db"
    }
  }
}
```

### Qdrant (Production)

{
  "embeddings": {
    "store": {
      "type": "qdrant",
      "url": "http://localhost:6333",
      "collection": "moltbot_docs"
    }
  }
}
```

### Pinecone (Cloud)

{
  "embeddings": {
    "store": {
      "type": "pinecone",
      "apiKey": "${PINECONE_API_KEY}",
      "environment": "us-east-1",
      "index": "moltbot"
    }
  }
}
```

## Index Documents

### Add Documents

```bash
# Index a directory
moltbot embeddings index ~/docs

# Index specific files
moltbot embeddings index ~/docs/api.md ~/docs/guide.md

# Index with metadata
moltbot embeddings index ~/docs --metadata '{"source": "documentation"}'
```

Output:
```
📊 Indexing Documents

Processing: 24 files
├─ api.md (12 chunks)
├─ guide.md (45 chunks)
├─ faq.md (8 chunks)
└─ ... 21 more

Total chunks: 234
Tokens used: 45,230
Time: 12.3s

Index ready at ~/.moltbot/vectors.db
```

### Index Configuration

```json
{
  "embeddings": {
    "indexing": {
      "chunkSize": 512,
      "chunkOverlap": 50,
      "splitBy": "sentence",
      "includeMetadata": true
    }
  }
}
```

## Semantic Search

### Search Documents

```
You: How do I configure authentication?

Moltbot: 🔍 Searching documentation...

Found 3 relevant sections:

1. **Authentication Setup** (similarity: 0.92)
   From: docs/security.md
   "Configure authentication by setting gateway.auth.password..."

2. **API Key Configuration** (similarity: 0.87)
   From: docs/api.md
   "Generate API keys using moltbot auth create-key..."

3. **OAuth Integration** (similarity: 0.81)
   From: docs/oauth.md
   "For SSO, configure OAuth providers in gateway.auth.oauth..."
```

### Search API

```javascript
const results = await moltbot.embeddings.search({
  query: "authentication configuration",
  limit: 5,
  filter: {
    source: "documentation"
  }
});

// Results
[
  { content: "...", similarity: 0.92, metadata: {...} },
  { content: "...", similarity: 0.87, metadata: {...} },
  ...
]
```

## RAG Implementation

### Enable RAG

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "rag": {
      "enabled": true,
      "sources": ["documentation", "knowledge-base"],
      "topK": 5,
      "minSimilarity": 0.7
    }
  }
}
```

### RAG Workflow

```
User: "How do I deploy to Docker?"

1. Query embedded → Vector search
2. Retrieve top 5 relevant chunks
3. Inject into context
4. LLM generates answer with sources
```

Example:
```
You: How do I deploy Moltbot to Docker?

Moltbot: Based on the documentation, here's how to deploy to Docker:

1. Create a docker-compose.yml:
   \`\`\`yaml
   services:
     moltbot:
       image: moltbot/moltbot:latest
       ports:
         - "127.0.0.1:18789:18789"
   \`\`\`

2. Set environment variables...

**Sources:**
- docs/docker-setup.md (section: Quick Start)
- docs/deployment.md (section: Docker Compose)
```

## Local Embeddings

### Using Ollama

```json
{
  "embeddings": {
    "provider": "ollama",
    "model": "nomic-embed-text",
    "url": "http://localhost:11434"
  }
}
```

```bash
# Pull embedding model
ollama pull nomic-embed-text

# Verify
moltbot embeddings test
```

### Using Sentence Transformers

```json
{
  "embeddings": {
    "provider": "local",
    "model": "all-MiniLM-L6-v2",
    "device": "cpu"
  }
}
```

## Knowledge Base

### Create Knowledge Base

```bash
moltbot kb create company-docs
```

### Add Content

```bash
# Add files
moltbot kb add company-docs ~/docs/policies/*.pdf

# Add URL
moltbot kb add company-docs https://docs.example.com/api

# Add text directly
moltbot kb add company-docs --text "Our return policy is 30 days..."
```

### Query Knowledge Base

```
You: What's our vacation policy?

Moltbot: 🔍 Searching company-docs...

According to the Employee Handbook (section 4.2):

"Employees receive 15 days of paid vacation annually,
accruing at 1.25 days per month. Unused vacation
carries over up to 5 days into the next year."

Source: employee-handbook.pdf, page 12
```

## Hybrid Search

Combine vector search with keyword matching:

```json
{
  "embeddings": {
    "search": {
      "type": "hybrid",
      "vectorWeight": 0.7,
      "keywordWeight": 0.3
    }
  }
}
```

## Embedding Statistics

```bash
moltbot embeddings stats
```

Output:
```
📊 Embedding Statistics

Index: moltbot_docs
├─ Documents: 124
├─ Chunks: 2,456
├─ Dimensions: 1536
└─ Size: 45.2 MB

Usage:
├─ Queries today: 234
├─ Avg latency: 45ms
└─ Cache hit rate: 78%

Top sources:
├─ documentation (45%)
├─ knowledge-base (32%)
└─ code-snippets (23%)
```

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Low similarity scores | Increase chunk overlap |
| Slow indexing | Use batch processing |
| Out of memory | Reduce chunk size |
| Missing context | Increase topK results |

### Debug Search

```bash
# Verbose search
moltbot embeddings search "authentication" --verbose

# Check index
moltbot embeddings verify

# Rebuild index
moltbot embeddings reindex
```

## Best Practices

| Practice | Benefit |
|----------|---------|
| Chunk by semantic units | Better retrieval |
| Include metadata | Filter results |
| Use hybrid search | Handle edge cases |
| Cache embeddings | Reduce costs |
| Regular reindexing | Fresh content |

## Introduction

Moltbot Embeddings: Semantic Search & RAG matters because it shapes how teams design reliable AI workflows and measure outcomes.
This guide explains the essentials and shows how Moltbot users can apply the ideas in a repeatable way.
You will get a clear path from prerequisites to practical steps, with examples, safeguards, and next steps.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| Node.js | 22+ (check: node --version) |
| OS | macOS, Linux, Windows (via WSL2) |
| Memory | 2GB RAM minimum (4GB+ recommended for browser automation) |
| Storage | 500MB for installation |

If you are already running Moltbot, you can skip installation and focus on configuration and workflows.

## How to apply this topic

> ⚠️ Review install scripts before running them in production. Avoid committing API keys or secrets to version control.

1. Install and onboard if you are new to the platform.
```bash
curl -fsSL https://clawd.bot/install.sh | bash
clawdbot onboard
clawdbot health
```

2. Start the gateway and confirm it is reachable locally.
```bash
clawdbot gateway --port 18789 --verbose
```

3. Connect one messaging channel and run a small workflow end-to-end.
Keep the scope small, measure latency, and expand only after you confirm stable behavior.

## Additional Notes

Moltbot workflows work best when you keep inputs tight and outputs measurable.
Define success criteria for moltbot embeddings: semantic search & rag before you automate anything significant.

For teams, document configuration changes and run clawdbot doctor after major edits.
This keeps the gateway stable and reduces debugging time when scaling up.

Key reminders:
- Keep tokens and passwords out of version control.
- Validate the gateway locally before exposing it.
- Roll out new skills in small batches and monitor logs.
- Re-check allow-lists after any channel changes.
