     What would you like help with?
```

### Via CLI (No Bot Setup)

```bash

```

Direct conversation:
```
You: What's the weather in Tokyo?

Moltbot: I'll check that for you...

         🌤️ Tokyo Weather Now:
         Temperature: 15°C (59°F)
         Condition: Partly cloudy
         Humidity: 45%

         Forecast: Clear skies expected tomorrow.
```

### Via Discord

1. Invite bot to server using OAuth URL from setup
2. Mention the bot in any channel:

```
@MoltBot summarize this article: https://example.com/article

MoltBot: 📄 Article Summary:

         Title: "AI Trends 2026"

         Key Points:
         • Multi-modal AI becoming standard

Last request: just now
Status: All systems operational
```

## First Run Configuration

Your configuration is saved at `~/.moltbot/moltbot.json`:

```json
{
  "gateway": {
    "port": 18789,
    "bind": "loopback"
  },
  "agent": {
    "provider": "anthropic",
    "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet",
    "systemPrompt": "You are a helpful personal assistant."
  },
  "channels": {
    "telegram": {
      "enabled": true,
      "allowedUsers": ["your_username"]
    }
  }
}
```

## What to Try Next

| Task | Example |
|------|---------|
| Ask a question | "What's the capital of France?" |
| Get help coding | "Write a Python function to sort a list" |
| Summarize content | "Summarize this: [paste text]" |
| Set a reminder | "Remind me to call mom at 5pm" |
| Research | "What are the best note-taking apps?" |

## Common First-Run Issues

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "Command not found" | Run the installer again, restart terminal |
| "API key invalid" | Verify key at provider's dashboard |
| "Port in use" | `moltbot gateway --port 18790` |
| "Bot not responding" | Check bot token, verify gateway is running |
| "Permission denied" | Run `chmod +x ~/.moltbot/bin/moltbot` |

### Debug Mode

If something isn't working:

```bash
moltbot gateway --verbose
```

Shows detailed logs:
```
[14:23:45] DEBUG Gateway binding to 127.0.0.1:18789
[14:23:45] DEBUG Anthropic provider initialized
[14:23:46] DEBUG Telegram polling started
[14:23:50] INFO  Message received from @user123
[14:23:51] DEBUG Sending to Anthropic: "Hello!"
[14:23:52] DEBUG Response received (234 tokens)
[14:23:52] INFO  Reply sent to @user123
```

## Security First Steps

Before using for sensitive tasks:

```bash
# Check security configuration
moltbot doctor
```

Output:
```
🔒 Security Check

Gateway:
├─ Bind: loopback ✅
├─ Auth: password set ✅
└─ HTTPS: not configured ⚠️

Channels:
├─ DM policy: pairing ✅
└─ Group tools: sandboxed ✅

Recommendations:
1. Set up reverse proxy with SSL for remote access
2. Review allowed users list

Overall: Good (2 warnings)
```

## Introduction

Moltbot First Run: Your First Message in 5 Minutes matters because it shapes how teams design reliable AI workflows and measure outcomes.
This guide explains the essentials and shows how Moltbot users can apply the ideas in a repeatable way.
You will get a clear path from prerequisites to practical steps, with examples, safeguards, and next steps.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|---|---|
| Command not found | Ensure Node.js 22+ is installed and your PATH is updated. |
| Gateway not reachable | Confirm the gateway is bound to loopback and port 18789 is free. |
| Auth errors | Verify API keys and rotate them if they may be exposed. |
| Slow responses | Reduce active skills, test a smaller model, and review logs. |
| Messages not delivered | Re-check channel tokens and allow-lists. |

## Additional Notes

Moltbot workflows work best when you keep inputs tight and outputs measurable.
Define success criteria for moltbot first run: your first message in 5 minutes before you automate anything significant.

For teams, document configuration changes and run clawdbot doctor after major edits.
This keeps the gateway stable and reduces debugging time when scaling up.

Key reminders:
- Keep tokens and passwords out of version control.
- Validate the gateway locally before exposing it.
- Roll out new skills in small batches and monitor logs.
- Re-check allow-lists after any channel changes.
