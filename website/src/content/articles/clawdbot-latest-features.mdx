```json
{
  "memory": {
    "type": "hierarchical",
    "shortTerm": {
      "maxMessages": 50,
      "ttl": 3600
    },
    "longTerm": {
      "enabled": true,
      "compression": true,

## Introduction

Moltbot v2.4: Latest Features & Improvements matters because it shapes how teams design reliable AI workflows and measure outcomes.
This guide explains the essentials and shows how Moltbot users can apply the ideas in a repeatable way.
You will get a clear path from prerequisites to practical steps, with examples, safeguards, and next steps.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| Node.js | 22+ (check: node --version) |
| OS | macOS, Linux, Windows (via WSL2) |
| Memory | 2GB RAM minimum (4GB+ recommended for browser automation) |
| Storage | 500MB for installation |

If you are already running Moltbot, you can skip installation and focus on configuration and workflows.

## How to apply this topic

> ⚠️ Review install scripts before running them in production. Avoid committing API keys or secrets to version control.

1. Install and onboard if you are new to the platform.
```bash
curl -fsSL https://clawd.bot/install.sh | bash
clawdbot onboard
clawdbot health
```

2. Start the gateway and confirm it is reachable locally.
```bash
clawdbot gateway --port 18789 --verbose
```

3. Connect one messaging channel and run a small workflow end-to-end.
Keep the scope small, measure latency, and expand only after you confirm stable behavior.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|---|---|
| Command not found | Ensure Node.js 22+ is installed and your PATH is updated. |
| Gateway not reachable | Confirm the gateway is bound to loopback and port 18789 is free. |
| Auth errors | Verify API keys and rotate them if they may be exposed. |
| Slow responses | Reduce active skills, test a smaller model, and review logs. |
| Messages not delivered | Re-check channel tokens and allow-lists. |

## Additional Notes

Moltbot workflows work best when you keep inputs tight and outputs measurable.
Define success criteria for moltbot v2.4: latest features & improvements before you automate anything significant.

For teams, document configuration changes and run clawdbot doctor after major edits.
This keeps the gateway stable and reduces debugging time when scaling up.

Key reminders:
- Keep tokens and passwords out of version control.
- Validate the gateway locally before exposing it.
- Roll out new skills in small batches and monitor logs.
- Re-check allow-lists after any channel changes.
