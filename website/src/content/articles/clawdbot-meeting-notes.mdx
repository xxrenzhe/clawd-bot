## Best Practices

| Practice | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------|
| Recording quality | Use dedicated mic, quiet room |
| Speaker identification | Ask participants to state name at start |
| Action items | Be explicit: "I'll do X by Y" |
| Follow-up timing | Send within 1 hour of meeting |
| Review | Scan AI summary for accuracy |

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Poor transcription | Improve audio quality, check mic |
| Wrong speakers | Enable speaker diarization |
| Missing actions | Use clearer commitment language |
| Summary too long | Set `style: "brief"` in config |

## Privacy Notes

| Setting | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|
| Recording consent | Always inform attendees |
| Storage | Use encrypted providers |
| Retention | Set auto-delete policy |
| Access | Limit to meeting attendees |
