```

## Uptime Monitoring

### Simple Health Check Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# health-check.sh

HEALTH=$(curl -s http://localhost:18789/health)
STATUS=$(echo $HEALTH | jq -r '.status')

if [ "$STATUS" != "healthy" ]; then
  echo "Moltbot unhealthy at $(date)" >> /var/log/moltbot-alerts.log

  # Send alert
  curl -X POST "https://api.telegram.org/bot$BOT_TOKEN/sendMessage" \
    -d "chat_id=$ALERT_CHAT_ID" \
    -d "text=🚨 Moltbot is unhealthy: $HEALTH"

  # Attempt restart
  moltbot gateway restart
fi
```

Add to cron:
```bash
*/5 * * * * /path/to/health-check.sh
```

### UptimeRobot / Uptime Kuma

Configure external monitoring to hit:
```
http://your-server:18789/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "uptime": 302400,
  "version": "2.4.1"

  - job_name: 'moltbot'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9090']
    scrape_interval: 15s
```

### Grafana Dashboard

Import dashboard JSON for:
- Request rate by channel
- Response time percentiles
- Token usage over time
- Error rate trending
- Cost tracking

## Docker Monitoring

```bash
# Container stats
docker stats moltbot

# Container logs
docker logs moltbot -f --tail 100

# Health check
docker inspect moltbot | jq '.[0].State.Health'
```

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Command |
|-------|---------|
| Check if running | `moltbot health` |
| View recent errors | `moltbot logs --level error --tail 50` |
| Check API connectivity | `moltbot doctor` |
| View resource usage | `moltbot stats` |
| Restart gateway | `moltbot gateway restart` |

### Common Issues

```bash
# High memory usage
moltbot cache clear

# Slow responses
moltbot logs --slow  # Shows requests > 5s

# Connection issues
moltbot doctor --verbose
```

## Monitoring Checklist

| Check | Frequency | Action if Failed |
|-------|-----------|------------------|
| Health endpoint | Every 5 min | Alert + auto-restart |
| Error rate | Hourly | Alert if > 5% |
| Response time | Hourly | Alert if P95 > 10s |
| Daily costs | Daily | Alert at 80% budget |
| Disk space | Daily | Alert at 80% |
| Log review | Weekly | Manual investigation |

## Introduction

Moltbot Monitoring: Logs, Metrics, Alerts matters because it shapes how teams design reliable AI workflows and measure outcomes.
This guide explains the essentials and shows how Moltbot users can apply the ideas in a repeatable way.
You will get a clear path from prerequisites to practical steps, with examples, safeguards, and next steps.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| Node.js | 22+ (check: node --version) |
| OS | macOS, Linux, Windows (via WSL2) |
| Memory | 2GB RAM minimum (4GB+ recommended for browser automation) |
| Storage | 500MB for installation |

If you are already running Moltbot, you can skip installation and focus on configuration and workflows.

## How to apply this topic

> ⚠️ Review install scripts before running them in production. Avoid committing API keys or secrets to version control.

1. Install and onboard if you are new to the platform.
```bash
curl -fsSL https://clawd.bot/install.sh | bash
clawdbot onboard
clawdbot health
```

2. Start the gateway and confirm it is reachable locally.
```bash
clawdbot gateway --port 18789 --verbose
```

3. Connect one messaging channel and run a small workflow end-to-end.
Keep the scope small, measure latency, and expand only after you confirm stable behavior.

## Additional Notes

Moltbot workflows work best when you keep inputs tight and outputs measurable.
Define success criteria for moltbot monitoring: logs, metrics, alerts before you automate anything significant.

For teams, document configuration changes and run clawdbot doctor after major edits.
This keeps the gateway stable and reduces debugging time when scaling up.

Key reminders:
- Keep tokens and passwords out of version control.
- Validate the gateway locally before exposing it.
- Roll out new skills in small batches and monitor logs.
- Re-check allow-lists after any channel changes.
