## Define Agents

### Specialist Agents

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "agents": {
      "researcher": {
        "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet",
        "systemPrompt": "You are a research specialist. Search for information, analyze sources, and summarize findings.",
        "tools": ["web_search", "web_fetch"],
        "temperature": 0.5
      },
      "coder": {
        "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet",
        "systemPrompt": "You are a coding specialist. Write, review, and debug code. Focus on clean, efficient solutions.",
        "tools": ["code_execute", "file_read", "file_write"],
        "temperature": 0.2
      },
      "writer": {
        "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet",
        "systemPrompt": "You are a writing specialist. Draft, edit, and polish content. Focus on clarity and engagement.",
        "tools": ["file_read", "file_write"],
        "temperature": 0.7
      },
      "reviewer": {
        "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet",
        "systemPrompt": "You are a QA specialist. Review work for errors, suggest improvements, and ensure quality.",
        "tools": ["file_read"],
        "temperature": 0.3
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Orchestrator Agent

### Configuration

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "orchestrator": {
      "enabled": true,
      "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet",
      "systemPrompt": "You are the orchestrator. Break complex tasks into subtasks, delegate to specialist agents, and synthesize results.",
      "canDelegate": ["researcher", "coder", "writer", "reviewer"],
      "maxDelegations": 10
    }
  }
}
```

### Delegation Flow

```
User: "Create a blog post about GraphQL vs REST APIs"

Orchestrator: I'll coordinate this task.

1. [Delegating to researcher] Research GraphQL vs REST comparison
2. [Delegating to coder] Create code examples for both
3. [Delegating to writer] Draft the blog post
4. [Delegating to reviewer] Review and polish

[researcher]: Found 5 key differences, performance benchmarks...
[coder]: Created 3 code examples for each approach...
[writer]: Drafted 1,500-word article with examples...
[reviewer]: Suggested 4 improvements, fixed 2 errors...

Orchestrator: Here's your completed blog post:
[Final synthesized content]
```

## Sequential Workflow

### Define Workflow

```json
{
  "workflows": {
    "content_pipeline": {
      "type": "sequential",
      "steps": [
        {
          "agent": "researcher",
          "task": "Research the topic",
          "output": "research_notes"
        },
        {
          "agent": "writer",
          "task": "Draft content using research",
          "input": "research_notes",
          "output": "draft"
        },
        {
          "agent": "reviewer",
          "task": "Review and suggest edits",
          "input": "draft",
          "output": "feedback"
        },
        {
          "agent": "writer",
          "task": "Apply feedback and finalize",
          "input": ["draft", "feedback"],
          "output": "final"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Run Workflow

```bash
moltbot workflow run content_pipeline --input "AI in healthcare"
```

## Parallel Execution

### Parallel Tasks

```json
{
  "workflows": {
    "multi_research": {
      "type": "parallel",
      "tasks": [
        {
          "agent": "researcher",
          "task": "Research competitor A",
          "output": "competitor_a"
        },
        {
          "agent": "researcher",
          "task": "Research competitor B",
          "output": "competitor_b"
        },
        {
          "agent": "researcher",
          "task": "Research market trends",
          "output": "trends"
        }
      ],
      "merge": {
        "agent": "writer",
        "task": "Synthesize research into report",
        "input": ["competitor_a", "competitor_b", "trends"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Execution

```
[Starting parallel tasks]
├─ [researcher] Researching competitor A... ✅ (3.2s)
├─ [researcher] Researching competitor B... ✅ (2.8s)
└─ [researcher] Researching market trends... ✅ (4.1s)

[Merging results]
└─ [writer] Creating synthesis report... ✅ (5.3s)

Total time: 9.4s (vs 15.4s sequential)
```

        "code": ["coder", "reviewer"],
        "all": ["*"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

{
  "agent": {
    "multiAgent": {
      "errorHandling": {
        "retry": {
          "maxAttempts": 3,
          "backoff": "exponential"

{
  "agent": {
    "supervision": {
      "enabled": true,
      "checkpoints": true,
      "rollback": "last_good"
    }
  }
}
```

## Monitoring Agents

```bash
moltbot agents status
```

Output:
```
📊 Agent Status

Active Agents: 4

Agent       | Status  | Tasks | Avg Time | Success
------------|---------|-------|----------|--------
orchestrator| idle    | 45    | 2.3s     | 98%
researcher  | running | 156   | 4.1s     | 95%
coder       | idle    | 89    | 3.8s     | 97%
writer      | running | 67    | 5.2s     | 99%

Current Tasks:
├─ [researcher] Researching market data (12s)
└─ [writer] Drafting summary (8s)
```

## Resource Limits

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "multiAgent": {
      "limits": {
        "maxTokensPerAgent": 100000,
        "maxConcurrent": 5,
        "maxTaskTime": 120000,
        "maxTotalCost": 10.00
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Slow coordination | Too many agents | Reduce concurrent limit |
| Conflicting outputs | No clear ownership | Define responsibilities |
| Infinite loops | Circular delegation | Set max delegations |
| High costs | Parallel overhead | Use sequential for simple tasks |

### Debug Multi-Agent

```bash
# View agent activity
moltbot agents logs --agent researcher

# Trace delegation
moltbot agents trace --task-id abc123

# Test workflow
moltbot workflow test content_pipeline --dry-run
```

## Introduction

Moltbot Multi-Agent: Orchestrate AI Teams matters because it shapes how teams design reliable AI workflows and measure outcomes.
This guide explains the essentials and shows how Moltbot users can apply the ideas in a repeatable way.
You will get a clear path from prerequisites to practical steps, with examples, safeguards, and next steps.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| Node.js | 22+ (check: node --version) |
| OS | macOS, Linux, Windows (via WSL2) |
| Memory | 2GB RAM minimum (4GB+ recommended for browser automation) |
| Storage | 500MB for installation |

If you are already running Moltbot, you can skip installation and focus on configuration and workflows.

## How to apply this topic

> ⚠️ Review install scripts before running them in production. Avoid committing API keys or secrets to version control.

1. Install and onboard if you are new to the platform.
```bash
curl -fsSL https://clawd.bot/install.sh | bash
clawdbot onboard
clawdbot health
```

2. Start the gateway and confirm it is reachable locally.
```bash
clawdbot gateway --port 18789 --verbose
```

3. Connect one messaging channel and run a small workflow end-to-end.
Keep the scope small, measure latency, and expand only after you confirm stable behavior.

## Additional Notes

Moltbot workflows work best when you keep inputs tight and outputs measurable.
Define success criteria for moltbot multi-agent: orchestrate ai teams before you automate anything significant.

For teams, document configuration changes and run clawdbot doctor after major edits.
This keeps the gateway stable and reduces debugging time when scaling up.

Key reminders:
- Keep tokens and passwords out of version control.
- Validate the gateway locally before exposing it.
- Roll out new skills in small batches and monitor logs.
- Re-check allow-lists after any channel changes.
