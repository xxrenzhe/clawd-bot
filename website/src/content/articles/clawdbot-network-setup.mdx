# Moltbot Network Setup: Ports, Firewalls, Remote Access

![Moltbot Network Setup](/images/articles/clawdbot-network-setup.jpg)

## Network Architecture

| Component | Port | Protocol | Direction |
|-----------|------|----------|-----------|
| Gateway | 18789 | HTTP | Inbound (local) |
| AI APIs | 443 | HTTPS | Outbound |
| Telegram | 443 | HTTPS | Outbound |
| Discord | 443 | HTTPS/WSS | Outbound |

**Key principle:** Never expose port 18789 to the internet. Use Tailscale or Cloudflare Tunnel instead.

<HostingCTA context="setup" />

## Default Configuration

Moltbot binds to localhost by default:

```json
{
  "gateway": {
    "bind": "loopback",
    "port": 18789
  }
}
```

This means:
- ✅ Accessible from `http://localhost:18789`
- ✅ Not accessible from other machines
- ✅ Safe default configuration

<HostingCTA context="inline" />

## Firewall Configuration

### Linux (UFW)

```bash
# Allow outbound HTTPS (usually default)
sudo ufw allow out 443

# Block gateway from external access (already blocked by loopback bind)
sudo ufw deny 18789

# Check status
sudo ufw status
```

### macOS

macOS doesn't block outbound by default. For extra security:

```bash
# Block inbound to gateway port
sudo pfctl -e
echo "block in on en0 proto tcp from any to any port 18789" | sudo pfctl -f -
```

### Windows (WSL2)

In Windows Firewall:
1. Advanced Settings → Outbound Rules
2. Allow TCP 443 (HTTPS)
3. Block TCP 18789 inbound

## Remote Access Options

### Option 1: Tailscale (Recommended)

Tailscale creates a private network between your devices.

**Install:**
```bash
# macOS
brew install tailscale

# Linux
curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh

# Start
sudo tailscale up
```

**Configure Moltbot for Tailscale:**
```json
{
  "gateway": {
    "bind": "100.x.x.x",  // Your Tailscale IP
    "port": 18789
  }
}
```

**Access:**
```bash
# From any device on your Tailscale network
curl http://100.x.x.x:18789/health
```

**Pros:**
- Zero config, works behind NAT
- Encrypted by default
- No port forwarding needed
- Free for personal use

### Option 2: Cloudflare Tunnel

Cloudflare Tunnel exposes your gateway through Cloudflare's network.

**Install:**
```bash
# macOS
brew install cloudflare/cloudflare/cloudflared

# Linux
curl -L https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-linux-amd64.deb -o cloudflared.deb
sudo dpkg -i cloudflared.deb
```

**Authenticate:**
```bash
cloudflared tunnel login
```

**Create tunnel:**
```bash
cloudflared tunnel create moltbot
cloudflared tunnel route dns moltbot ai.yourdomain.com
```

**Configure:**
```yaml
# ~/.cloudflared/config.yml
tunnel: moltbot
credentials-file: /home/user/.cloudflared/TUNNEL_ID.json

ingress:
  - hostname: ai.yourdomain.com
    service: http://localhost:18789
  - service: http_status:404
```

**Run:**
```bash
cloudflared tunnel run moltbot
```

**Access:**
```
https://ai.yourdomain.com
```

**Pros:**
- HTTPS automatically
- DDoS protection
- Works behind any NAT
- No open ports

### Option 3: SSH Tunnel

For ad-hoc access from another machine:

```bash
# From your laptop, tunnel to your server
ssh -L 18789:localhost:18789 user@your-server

# Now access locally
curl http://localhost:18789/health
```

## Bind Options

| Bind Setting | Accessible From |
|--------------|-----------------|
| `"loopback"` | Same machine only |
| `"127.0.0.1"` | Same machine only |
| `"0.0.0.0"` | Any network interface (dangerous) |
| `"100.x.x.x"` | Specific interface (Tailscale) |
| `"192.168.1.x"` | Local network |

### Local Network Access

For access from other devices on your home network:

```json
{
  "gateway": {
    "bind": "0.0.0.0",
    "port": 18789,
    "auth": {
      "password": "strong-password-here"
    },
    "allowedIPs": ["192.168.1.0/24"]
  }
}
```

This:
- Binds to all interfaces
- Requires password auth
- Only allows IPs from 192.168.1.x range

## DNS Configuration

### Local DNS (Pi-hole, AdGuard)

Add a local DNS record:
```
moltbot.local → 192.168.1.x
```

Access via:
```
http://moltbot.local:18789
```

### mDNS (Bonjour)

On macOS, access via hostname automatically:
```
http://macmini.local:18789
```

## Outbound Connections

Moltbot needs to reach these endpoints:

| Service | Endpoint | Port |
|---------|----------|------|
| Anthropic | api.anthropic.com | 443 |
| OpenAI | api.openai.com | 443 |
| Telegram | api.telegram.org | 443 |
| Discord | gateway.discord.gg | 443 |

### Verify Connectivity

```bash
# Test Anthropic API
curl -I https://api.anthropic.com

# Test Telegram
curl -I https://api.telegram.org

# Test Discord
curl -I https://gateway.discord.gg
```

### Corporate Proxy

If behind a proxy:

```bash
export HTTP_PROXY=http://proxy.company.com:8080
export HTTPS_PROXY=http://proxy.company.com:8080
export NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1

moltbot gateway
```

Or in config:
```json
{
  "network": {
    "proxy": "http://proxy.company.com:8080"
  }
}
```

## Security Checklist

| Setting | Recommended | Why |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| Bind | `loopback` | Prevents external access |
| Auth password | Set | Protects dashboard |
| Trusted proxies | Configure | For reverse proxy |
| Allowed IPs | Restrict | Limit access scope |

### Verify Security

```bash
moltbot doctor --security
```

Output:
```
🔒 Network Security

Bind: loopback ✅
Auth: password set ✅
External access: blocked ✅

Outbound:
├─ api.anthropic.com: reachable ✅
├─ api.telegram.org: reachable ✅
└─ gateway.discord.gg: reachable ✅

Status: Secure
```

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Check | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Can't access remotely | Bind setting | Use Tailscale or Tunnel |
| API calls failing | Firewall | Allow outbound 443 |
| Timeout errors | DNS | Check resolver |
| Connection refused | Port | Verify gateway is running |

### Debug Network

```bash
# Check what's listening
lsof -i :18789

# Test local access
curl http://localhost:18789/health

# Check outbound
curl -v https://api.anthropic.com
```

## Introduction

Moltbot Network: Ports, Firewalls, Remote Access matters because it shapes how teams design reliable AI workflows and measure outcomes.
This guide explains the essentials and shows how Moltbot users can apply the ideas in a repeatable way.
You will get a clear path from prerequisites to practical steps, with examples, safeguards, and next steps.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| Node.js | 22+ (check: node --version) |
| OS | macOS, Linux, Windows (via WSL2) |
| Memory | 2GB RAM minimum (4GB+ recommended for browser automation) |
| Storage | 500MB for installation |

If you are already running Moltbot, you can skip installation and focus on configuration and workflows.

## How to apply this topic

> ⚠️ Review install scripts before running them in production. Avoid committing API keys or secrets to version control.

1. Install and onboard if you are new to the platform.
```bash
curl -fsSL https://clawd.bot/install.sh | bash
clawdbot onboard
clawdbot health
```

2. Start the gateway and confirm it is reachable locally.
```bash
clawdbot gateway --port 18789 --verbose
```

3. Connect one messaging channel and run a small workflow end-to-end.
Keep the scope small, measure latency, and expand only after you confirm stable behavior.

## Additional Notes

Moltbot workflows work best when you keep inputs tight and outputs measurable.
Define success criteria for moltbot network: ports, firewalls, remote access before you automate anything significant.

For teams, document configuration changes and run clawdbot doctor after major edits.
This keeps the gateway stable and reduces debugging time when scaling up.

Key reminders:
- Keep tokens and passwords out of version control.
- Validate the gateway locally before exposing it.
- Roll out new skills in small batches and monitor logs.
- Re-check allow-lists after any channel changes.
