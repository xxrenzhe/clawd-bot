## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Notes |
|-------------|-------|
| Moltbot installed | `moltbot health` |
| Notion account | Free or paid |
| Notion integration | Created at notion.so/my-integrations |

## Step 1: Create Notion Integration

1. Go to [notion.so/my-integrations](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations)
2. Click "New integration"
3. Name: "Moltbot"
4. Select your workspace
5. Capabilities: Check "Read content", "Update content", "Insert content"
6. Click "Submit"
7. Copy the "Internal Integration Token" (starts with `secret_`)

## Step 2: Install Notion Skill

```bash

```

## Step 3: Add Token to Moltbot

```

Add to shell profile:
```bash

```

<HostingCTA context="inline" />

## Step 4: Share Pages with Integration

**Important:** Your integration can only access pages you explicitly share.

1. Open a Notion page or database
2. Click "..." menu → "Connections"
3. Find "Moltbot" and click "Connect"

Repeat for each page/database you want Moltbot to access.

## Step 5: Configure

```bash
moltbot configure --section skills.notion
```

Or edit config:
```json
{
  "skills": {
    "notion": {
      "token": "${NOTION_TOKEN}",
      "defaultDatabase": "Tasks",
      "workspacePages": ["Meeting Notes", "Projects", "Tasks"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Using Notion Commands

### Create a Page

```
You: Create a meeting notes page for the product review
Moltbot: Created page: "Product Review - Jan 29, 2026"

## Database Templates

Set up templates for common actions:

```json
{
  "skills": {
    "notion": {
      "templates": {
        "meeting": {
          "database": "Meeting Notes",
          "properties": {
            "Date": "{{today}}",
            "Type": "Meeting"
          }
        },

            "Created": "{{today}}"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Usage:
```
You: Create a meeting note
Moltbot: [Uses meeting template automatically]
```

## Quick Capture

Capture ideas from anywhere:

```
You: Quick note: We should add dark mode to the dashboard
Moltbot: Added to Inbox:
         💡 "We should add dark mode to the dashboard"
         📅 Captured: Jan 29, 2026 3:45 PM
         🏷️ Tags: #idea #dashboard
```

Configure inbox:
```json
{
  "skills": {
    "notion": {
      "inbox": {
        "database": "Inbox",
        "autoTag": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Automation Examples

### Daily Summary

```json
{
  "automations": {
    "daily_notion_summary": {
      "time": "18:00",
      "action": "notion_daily_summary",
      "channel": "telegram"
    }
  }
}
```

Every evening:
```
📊 Today's Notion Activity:

Created: 3 pages

- Task: Review PR #123
- Note: Dark mode idea

Completed: 2 tasks
- Fix login bug ✅
- Update docs ✅

Due tomorrow: 1 task
- Review PR #123
```

### Meeting Notes to Tasks

```
You: Extract action items from today's meeting notes
Moltbot: Found 4 action items in "Product Review - Jan 29":

         1. "Sarah to finalize mockups" → Due: Feb 2
         2. "John to review API changes" → Due: Feb 1
         3. "Team to test staging" → Due: Feb 3
         4. "Mike to update roadmap" → Due: Feb 5

         Create tasks in database?
```

## Security Considerations

| Setting | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|
| Integration scope | Only share needed pages |
| Token storage | Environment variable |
| Sensitive pages | Don't share with integration |

### Limit Access

Only share specific pages:
- ✅ Work databases
- ✅ Meeting notes
- ❌ Personal journal
- ❌ Salary information

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Page not found" | Share page with Moltbot integration |
| "Unauthorized" | Check token is correct and not expired |
| "Database not found" | Share database, not just pages in it |
| Properties missing | Check database schema matches config |

**Test connection:**
```bash
moltbot skill test notion search --query="test"
```

**List accessible pages:**
```bash
moltbot skill test notion list-pages
```

## Additional Notes

Moltbot workflows work best when you keep inputs tight and outputs measurable.
Define success criteria for moltbot notion integration: ai-powered notes before you automate anything significant.

For teams, document configuration changes and run clawdbot doctor after major edits.
This keeps the gateway stable and reduces debugging time when scaling up.

Key reminders:
- Keep tokens and passwords out of version control.
- Validate the gateway locally before exposing it.
- Roll out new skills in small batches and monitor logs.
- Re-check allow-lists after any channel changes.
