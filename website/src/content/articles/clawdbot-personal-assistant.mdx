         - 30-hour battery
         - Excellent call quality

         **Best Value:** Sony WH-1000XM4 ($228)
         - Previous gen, still excellent
         - Similar features, lower price

         **Best for Apple:** AirPods Max ($449, over budget)
         - Consider AirPods Pro 2 ($249) instead

         Want me to find current prices or reviews?
```

## Step 6: Smart Home Control

### Connect Smart Devices

```

Moltbot: ✅ Living room lights off

You: Set thermostat to 72

         Current: 68°F, will reach 72°F in ~15 min

  "preferences": {
    "weather_units": "fahrenheit",
    "news_sources": ["techcrunch", "reuters"],
    "morning_briefing_time": "07:30"
  }
}
```

### Memory

Moltbot remembers context:

```
You: I prefer morning meetings
Moltbot: ✅ Noted: You prefer morning meetings.
         I'll consider this when suggesting times.

[Later...]

You: Find time for a call with Sarah next week
Moltbot: Based on your preference for morning meetings:

         Available slots:
         • Monday 9:00-10:00 AM
         • Wednesday 10:00-11:00 AM
         • Friday 9:30-10:30 AM

         Which works best?
```

## Daily Workflows

### Morning Routine

```
07:30 - Morning briefing arrives
07:35 - "What's the traffic to work?"
08:00 - "Remind me to submit report at 4pm"
```

### During the Day

```
"Summarize the email from marketing"
"Add milk to my shopping list"
"What time is my next meeting?"

```

### Evening Routine

## Advanced: Multiple Personas

Create different modes:

```json
{
  "modes": {
    "work": {
      "skills": ["email", "calendar", "jira", "github"],
      "tone": "professional"
    },
    "personal": {
      "skills": ["reminders", "shopping", "recipes"],
      "tone": "casual"
    },
    "focus": {
      "skills": ["timer", "pomodoro"],
      "notifications": "minimal"
    }
  }
}
```

Switch modes:
```
You: Switch to work mode
Moltbot: 💼 Work mode activated
         - Email, Calendar, Jira, GitHub enabled
         - Personal skills disabled
```

## Privacy & Security

| Setting | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|
| DM policy | Set to "pairing" mode |
| Data storage | Local only (no cloud sync) |
| API provider | Claude for best privacy policy |
| Sensitive data | Don't share passwords, SSN |

All data stays on your machine. Conversations go to Claude API but aren't stored for training.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Morning briefing not arriving | Check automation time and timezone |
| Skills not working | Run `moltbot skill list` to verify installed |
| Slow responses | Check API key and network connection |
| Memory not persisting | Verify `~/.moltbot/memory/` exists |

**Check status:**
```bash
moltbot doctor
moltbot gateway status
```

## Cost Estimates

| Usage | Monthly Cost |
|-------|--------------|
| Light (20 messages/day) | ~$5 |
| Moderate (50 messages/day) | ~$12 |
| Heavy (100+ messages/day) | ~$25 |
