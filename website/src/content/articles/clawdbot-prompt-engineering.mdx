# 10 Moltbot Prompt Tricks for Better AI Responses

![Moltbot Prompt Engineering](/images/articles/clawdbot-prompt-engineering.jpg)

## Why Prompts Matter

The same question can get vastly different responses depending on how you ask:

| Prompt | Response Quality |
|--------|------------------|
| "Write code" | Vague, generic |
| "Write a Python function that validates email addresses" | Better |
| "Write a Python function that validates email addresses using regex, with examples and error handling" | Best |

## System Prompts

System prompts define your AI's behavior globally. Set in your config:

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "systemPrompt": "You are a helpful personal assistant. Be concise. When asked about tasks, always confirm the action before executing. Prefer bullet points for lists."
  }
}
```

### Effective System Prompt Template

```
You are [role] for [user context].

Your communication style:
- [tone: professional/casual/friendly]
- [length: concise/detailed]
- [format: bullets/prose/structured]

Your capabilities:
- [skill 1]
- [skill 2]

Your constraints:
- [what not to do]
- [when to ask for clarification]
```

### Example: Developer Assistant

```
You are a senior software engineer assistant for a startup.

Your communication style:
- Technical but clear
- Concise, avoid unnecessary explanation
- Use code blocks with syntax highlighting

Your capabilities:
- Code review and debugging
- Architecture suggestions
- Best practices advice

Your constraints:
- Don't write code without understanding the context first
- Ask clarifying questions for ambiguous requests
- Recommend tests for any code changes
```

## Prompting Techniques

### 1. Be Specific

❌ Bad: "Help with my email"
✅ Good: "Draft a polite reply declining the meeting invitation from Sarah"

❌ Bad: "Fix this bug"
✅ Good: "The login fails on Safari mobile. Error: 'undefined is not a function' at line 42 of auth.js"

### 2. Provide Context

```
You: My project uses React 18, TypeScript, and Tailwind.
     The auth system uses JWT with refresh tokens.

     How should I handle token expiration?
```

### 3. Specify Output Format

```
You: List the top 5 coffee shops near downtown.
     Format: Name, Rating (stars), Distance, Price range
```

Output:
```
1. Blue Bottle - ⭐4.7 - 0.2mi - $$$
2. Stumptown - ⭐4.5 - 0.3mi - $$
3. Ritual Coffee - ⭐4.6 - 0.4mi - $$
...
```

### 4. Few-Shot Examples

Teach by example:

```
You: Convert these to past tense:

     Example:
     "I eat breakfast" → "I ate breakfast"
     "She runs fast" → "She ran fast"

     Now convert:
     "They write code"
     "He thinks deeply"
```

### 5. Chain of Thought

For complex reasoning:

```
You: Should I take the job offer?

     Current: $120k, remote, good WLB, boring work
     Offer: $150k, hybrid, startupfast-paced, exciting tech

     Think through the pros and cons step by step.
```

### 6. Role Playing

```
You: Act as a skeptical investor reviewing my startup pitch.
     Poke holes in my business model and ask tough questions.

     My pitch: [your pitch here]
```

## Channel-Specific Prompts

Configure different behaviors per channel:

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "telegram": {
      "systemPrompt": "Be very concise. Use emojis. This is mobile."
    },
    "discord": {
      "serverConfigs": {
        "dev-team": {
          "systemPrompt": "You're the team's dev assistant. Be technical. Help with code reviews and debugging."
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Skill Prompts

Each skill can have its own prompt context:

```json
{
  "skills": {
    "email": {
      "systemPrompt": "When drafting emails, match the sender's tone. Keep emails under 200 words unless asked otherwise."
    },
    "code-review": {
      "systemPrompt": "Focus on security, performance, and maintainability. Be constructive, not critical."
    }
  }
}
```

## Common Patterns

### Decision Helper

```
You: I'm deciding between [A] and [B].
     My priorities are: [list]
     My constraints are: [list]

     Create a comparison table and give a recommendation.
```

### Research Request

```
You: Research [topic].

     I need:
     - Key facts (bullet points)
     - Pros and cons
     - Common misconceptions
     - Trusted sources

     Depth: [brief overview / comprehensive / expert-level]
```

### Draft Generator

```
You: Draft a [type of content] about [topic].

     Audience: [who]
     Tone: [formal/casual/professional]
     Length: [word count or short/medium/long]
     Purpose: [inform/persuade/entertain]

     Include: [specific elements]
     Avoid: [what to skip]
```

### Debug Assistant

```
You: Debug this issue:

     Expected: [what should happen]
     Actual: [what happens]
     Error: [error message]
     Code: [relevant code]

     Environment: [OS, versions, etc.]
     Already tried: [what you've attempted]
```

## Prompt Variables

Use variables for dynamic prompts:

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "systemPrompt": "You are {{user_name}}'s assistant. Today is {{date}}. User's timezone is {{timezone}}."
  }
}
```

Available variables:
- `{{user_name}}` - User's configured name
- `{{date}}` - Current date
- `{{time}}` - Current time
- `{{timezone}}` - User's timezone
- `{{channel}}` - Current channel (telegram, discord, etc.)

## Troubleshooting

### AI Too Verbose

Add to system prompt:
```
Be concise. Aim for 2-3 sentences unless more detail is requested.
```

### AI Not Following Instructions

Be more explicit:
```
IMPORTANT: Always format code with syntax highlighting.
REQUIRED: Ask for confirmation before any action.
```

### AI Hallucinating

Add constraints:
```
If you don't know something, say "I don't know" rather than guessing.
Only cite sources you can verify.
```

### Inconsistent Responses

Add examples:
```
When I ask "status", respond exactly like this:
"📊 Status: [healthy/warning/error]
📅 Last check: [time]
📝 Details: [brief summary]"
```

## Testing Prompts

Test prompt changes before deploying:

```bash
moltbot chat --config test-config.json
```

Create a test config with your experimental prompts:
```json
{
  "agent": {
    "systemPrompt": "Your experimental prompt here..."
  }
}
```

## Cost Optimization

Longer prompts = more tokens = higher cost.

| Prompt Length | Est. Cost/Request |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Short (50 tokens) | $0.0002 |
| Medium (200 tokens) | $0.0006 |
| Long (500 tokens) | $0.0015 |

Tips:
- Keep system prompts under 300 tokens
- Remove unnecessary examples after behavior is learned
- Use channel-specific prompts only where needed

## Introduction

10 Moltbot Prompt Tricks for Better AI Responses matters because it shapes how teams design reliable AI workflows and measure outcomes.
This guide explains the essentials and shows how Moltbot users can apply the ideas in a repeatable way.
You will get a clear path from prerequisites to practical steps, with examples, safeguards, and next steps.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| Node.js | 22+ (check: node --version) |
| OS | macOS, Linux, Windows (via WSL2) |
| Memory | 2GB RAM minimum (4GB+ recommended for browser automation) |
| Storage | 500MB for installation |

If you are already running Moltbot, you can skip installation and focus on configuration and workflows.

## How to apply this topic

> ⚠️ Review install scripts before running them in production. Avoid committing API keys or secrets to version control.

1. Install and onboard if you are new to the platform.
```bash
curl -fsSL https://clawd.bot/install.sh | bash
clawdbot onboard
clawdbot health
```

2. Start the gateway and confirm it is reachable locally.
```bash
clawdbot gateway --port 18789 --verbose
```

3. Connect one messaging channel and run a small workflow end-to-end.
Keep the scope small, measure latency, and expand only after you confirm stable behavior.

## Additional Notes

Moltbot workflows work best when you keep inputs tight and outputs measurable.
Define success criteria for 10 moltbot prompt tricks for better ai responses before you automate anything significant.

For teams, document configuration changes and run clawdbot doctor after major edits.
This keeps the gateway stable and reduces debugging time when scaling up.

Key reminders:
- Keep tokens and passwords out of version control.
- Validate the gateway locally before exposing it.
- Roll out new skills in small batches and monitor logs.
- Re-check allow-lists after any channel changes.
