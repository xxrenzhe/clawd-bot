# 10 Moltbot Prompt Tricks for Better AI Responses

![Moltbot Prompt Engineering](/images/articles/clawdbot-prompt-engineering.jpg)

## Why Prompts Matter

The same question can get vastly different responses depending on how you ask:

| Prompt | Response Quality |
|--------|------------------|
| "Write code" | Vague, generic |
| "Write a Python function that validates email addresses" | Better |
| "Write a Python function that validates email addresses using regex, with examples and error handling" | Best |

## System Prompts

System prompts define your AI's behavior globally. Set in your config:

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "systemPrompt": "You are a helpful personal assistant. Be concise. When asked about tasks, always confirm the action before executing. Prefer bullet points for lists."
  }
}
```

### Effective System Prompt Template

```
You are [role] for [user context].

Your communication style:
- [tone: professional/casual/friendly]
- [length: concise/detailed]
- [format: bullets/prose/structured]

Your capabilities:
- [skill 1]
- [skill 2]

Your constraints:
- [what not to do]
- [when to ask for clarification]
```

### Example: Developer Assistant

```
You are a senior software engineer assistant for a startup.

Your communication style:
- Technical but clear
- Concise, avoid unnecessary explanation
- Use code blocks with syntax highlighting

Your capabilities:
- Code review and debugging
- Architecture suggestions
- Best practices advice

Your constraints:
- Don't write code without understanding the context first
- Ask clarifying questions for ambiguous requests
- Recommend tests for any code changes
```

## Prompting Techniques

### 1. Be Specific

❌ Bad: "Help with my email"
✅ Good: "Draft a polite reply declining the meeting invitation from Sarah"

❌ Bad: "Fix this bug"
✅ Good: "The login fails on Safari mobile. Error: 'undefined is not a function' at line 42 of auth.js"

### 2. Provide Context

```
You: My project uses React 18, TypeScript, and Tailwind.
     The auth system uses JWT with refresh tokens.

     How should I handle token expiration?
```

### 3. Specify Output Format

```
You: List the top 5 coffee shops near downtown.
     Format: Name, Rating (stars), Distance, Price range
```

Output:
```
1. Blue Bottle - ⭐4.7 - 0.2mi - $$$
2. Stumptown - ⭐4.5 - 0.3mi - $$
3. Ritual Coffee - ⭐4.6 - 0.4mi - $$
...
```

### 4. Few-Shot Examples

Teach by example:

```
You: Convert these to past tense:

     Example:
     "I eat breakfast" → "I ate breakfast"
     "She runs fast" → "She ran fast"

     Now convert:
     "They write code"
     "He thinks deeply"
```

### 5. Chain of Thought

For complex reasoning:

```
You: Should I take the job offer?

     Current: $120k, remote, good WLB, boring work
     Offer: $150k, hybrid, startupfast-paced, exciting tech

     Think through the pros and cons step by step.
```

### 6. Role Playing

```
You: Act as a skeptical investor reviewing my startup pitch.
     Poke holes in my business model and ask tough questions.

     My pitch: [your pitch here]
```

## Channel-Specific Prompts

Configure different behaviors per channel:

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "telegram": {
      "systemPrompt": "Be very concise. Use emojis. This is mobile."
    },
    "discord": {
      "serverConfigs": {
        "dev-team": {
          "systemPrompt": "You're the team's dev assistant. Be technical. Help with code reviews and debugging."
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Skill Prompts

Each skill can have its own prompt context:

```json
{
  "skills": {
    "email": {
      "systemPrompt": "When drafting emails, match the sender's tone. Keep emails under 200 words unless asked otherwise."
    },
    "code-review": {
      "systemPrompt": "Focus on security, performance, and maintainability. Be constructive, not critical."
    }
  }
}
```

## Common Patterns

### Decision Helper

```
You: I'm deciding between [A] and [B].
     My priorities are: [list]
     My constraints are: [list]

     Create a comparison table and give a recommendation.
```

### Research Request

```
You: Research [topic].

     I need:
     - Key facts (bullet points)
     - Pros and cons
     - Common misconceptions
     - Trusted sources

     Depth: [brief overview / comprehensive / expert-level]
```

### Draft Generator

```
You: Draft a [type of content] about [topic].

     Audience: [who]
     Tone: [formal/casual/professional]
     Length: [word count or short/medium/long]
     Purpose: [inform/persuade/entertain]

     Include: [specific elements]
     Avoid: [what to skip]
```

### Debug Assistant

```
You: Debug this issue:

     Expected: [what should happen]
     Actual: [what happens]
     Error: [error message]
     Code: [relevant code]

     Environment: [OS, versions, etc.]
     Already tried: [what you've attempted]
```

## Prompt Variables

Use variables for dynamic prompts:

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "systemPrompt": "You are {{user_name}}'s assistant. Today is {{date}}. User's timezone is {{timezone}}."
  }
}
```

Available variables:
- `{{user_name}}` - User's configured name
- `{{date}}` - Current date
- `{{time}}` - Current time
- `{{timezone}}` - User's timezone
- `{{channel}}` - Current channel (telegram, discord, etc.)

## Troubleshooting

### AI Too Verbose

Add to system prompt:
```
Be concise. Aim for 2-3 sentences unless more detail is requested.
```

### AI Not Following Instructions

Be more explicit:
```
IMPORTANT: Always format code with syntax highlighting.
REQUIRED: Ask for confirmation before any action.
```

### AI Hallucinating

Add constraints:
```
If you don't know something, say "I don't know" rather than guessing.
Only cite sources you can verify.
```

### Inconsistent Responses

Add examples:
```
When I ask "status", respond exactly like this:
"📊 Status: [healthy/warning/error]
📅 Last check: [time]
📝 Details: [brief summary]"
```

## Testing Prompts

Test prompt changes before deploying:

```bash
moltbot chat --config test-config.json
```

Create a test config with your experimental prompts:
```json
{
  "agent": {
    "systemPrompt": "Your experimental prompt here..."
  }
}
```

## Cost Optimization

Longer prompts = more tokens = higher cost.

| Prompt Length | Est. Cost/Request |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Short (50 tokens) | $0.0002 |
| Medium (200 tokens) | $0.0006 |
| Long (500 tokens) | $0.0015 |

Tips:
- Keep system prompts under 300 tokens
- Remove unnecessary examples after behavior is learned
- Use channel-specific prompts only where needed
