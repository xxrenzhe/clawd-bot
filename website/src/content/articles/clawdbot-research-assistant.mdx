### Current Information

```
You: What's the latest news about AI regulation in the EU?

Moltbot: **EU AI Act Updates (Jan 2026):**

         1. **Implementation began** - First provisions
            took effect December 2025

         2. **Prohibited AI systems** now banned:
            - Social scoring
            - Real-time biometric surveillance
            - Emotion recognition in workplaces

         3. **High-risk AI** requirements active:
            - Must register in EU database
            - Mandatory risk assessments
            - Human oversight required

         4. **Next deadlines:**
            - Aug 2026: General-purpose AI rules
            - Aug 2027: Full enforcement

         Sources: [European Commission], [Reuters], [TechCrunch]

### Technology Research

```
You: Compare the top 3 vector databases for AI applications

Moltbot: **Vector Database Comparison (2026):**

         | Feature | Pinecone | Weaviate | Milvus |
         |---------|----------|----------|--------|
         | Hosting | Cloud-only | Cloud/Self | Self-hosted |
         | Free tier | 100K vectors | 500K vectors | Unlimited |
         | Speed | Fastest | Fast | Very fast |
         | Ease of use | Easiest | Easy | Medium |
         | Price | $$$ | $$ | Free (OSS) |

         **Recommendations:**
         - **Pinecone**: Best for production, managed
         - **Weaviate**: Good balance, has free cloud
         - **Milvus**: Best for self-hosting, cost control

         **Key factors:**
         - Pinecone: 10ms p99 latency
         - Weaviate: Built-in hybrid search
         - Milvus: GPU acceleration support
```

## Document Analysis

### PDF Summarization

```
You: Summarize this research paper
     [attaches: quantum_computing_2026.pdf]

Moltbot: **Summary: "Quantum Computing: State of the Art 2026"**

         **Key findings:**
         1. Quantum advantage demonstrated in 3 new
            domains beyond optimization
         2. Error correction threshold achieved
            by 2 companies
         3. 1000+ qubit systems now operational

         **Main contributions:**
         - Novel error correction approach (Section 3)
         - Benchmark suite for QC applications
         - Cost-benefit analysis vs classical computing

         **Limitations noted:**
         - Coherence times still limiting factor
         - Cryogenic requirements unchanged
         - Classical simulation still viable for many tasks

         **Conclusion:**
         Practical quantum advantage for specific
         enterprise applications within 2 years.

### Document Comparison

```
You: Compare these two contracts and highlight differences
     [attaches: contract_v1.pdf, contract_v2.pdf]

Moltbot: **Contract Comparison: v1 vs v2**

         **Key changes:**

         | Section | v1 | v2 | Impact |
         |---------|----|----|--------|
         | Payment terms | Net 30 | Net 45 | Worse for you |
         | Liability cap | $100K | $50K | Worse for you |
         | Termination | 30 days | 90 days | Neutral |
         | IP rights | Shared | You retain | Better for you |

         **New in v2:**
         - Non-compete clause (Section 8.2) ⚠️
         - Audit rights for vendor
         - Auto-renewal clause

         **Removed from v1:**
         - Performance guarantees
         - SLA with penalties

         **Recommendation:**
         v2 favors the vendor. Key concerns:
         1. Non-compete is broad (2 years, global)
         2. No performance SLA
         3. Extended payment terms hurt cash flow

         Consider negotiating: liability cap,
         SLA restoration, narrower non-compete.
```

## Fact Checking

```
You: Is it true that honey never spoils?

Moltbot: **Partially true, with caveats.**

         ✅ **Accurate:**
         - Honey found in Egyptian tombs (3000+ years)
           was still edible
         - Low water activity prevents bacterial growth
         - High acidity (pH 3.4-6.1) inhibits microbes
         - Natural hydrogen peroxide production

         ⚠️ **Caveats:**
         - Must be pure, unadulterated honey
         - Must be stored properly (sealed, dry)
         - Crystallization happens but doesn't mean spoiled
         - Moisture contamination can cause fermentation

         ❌ **Misconceptions:**
         - Not "indefinite" if improperly stored
         - Adulterated honey (with sugar) can spoil
         - Infant botulism risk remains

         **Sources:**
         - National Honey Board
         - Journal of Food Science (2018 study)
         - Smithsonian Magazine
```

## Deep Research

### Multi-Step Research

```
You: Research: What's the best tech stack for a real-time
     collaborative document editor in 2026?

Moltbot: **Real-time Collaborative Editor Tech Stack (2026)**

         ## Research Summary

         Analyzed 15 production apps including Notion,
         Figma, Google Docs, Linear.

         ### Recommended Stack:

         **Frontend:**
         - React 19 or SolidJS
         - TipTap or ProseMirror (editor)
         - Yjs (CRDT library) ⭐ most recommended

         **Backend:**
         - Node.js with Hocuspocus (Yjs server)
         - Or: Liveblocks (managed service)

         **Database:**
         - PostgreSQL (persistence)
         - Redis (presence, cursors)

         **Real-time:**
         - WebSockets via Socket.io or native
         - Consider WebRTC for P2P (reduces server load)

         ### Key Decision: CRDT vs OT

         | | CRDT (Yjs) | OT (ShareDB) |
         |-|------------|--------------|
         | Complexity | Lower | Higher |
         | Offline | Better | Limited |
         | Conflict resolution | Automatic | Server-managed |
         | Adoption (2026) | 70%+ | Declining |

         **Verdict:** Yjs + Hocuspocus is the standard.

         ### Cost Estimate:

         | Approach | Monthly (1K users) |
         |----------|--------------------|
         | Self-hosted Yjs | $50-100 |
         | Liveblocks | $200-500 |
         | Build from scratch | Not recommended |

         ### Sources:
         - Yjs documentation
         - "Building Collaborative Apps" (O'Reilly 2025)
         - Figma engineering blog
         - Interviews with 3 production teams

      "defaultDepth": "comprehensive",
      "includeSources": true,
      "factCheck": true,
      "maxSearchResults": 10
    }
  }
}
```

### Research Modes

| Mode | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `quick` | 2-3 sources, summary | Quick answers |
| `standard` | 5-7 sources, analysis | General research |
| `comprehensive` | 10+ sources, deep dive | Important decisions |

## Best Practices

1. **Be specific** - "AI regulation" → "EU AI Act 2026 compliance requirements for chatbots"

2. **Specify format** - "Give me a comparison table" or "List pros and cons"

3. **Request sources** - "Include sources" ensures verifiable information

4. **Iterate** - "Tell me more about point 3" to dive deeper

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Outdated information | Add "latest" or "2026" to query |
| No sources cited | Enable `includeSources` in config |
| Too shallow | Use "comprehensive" depth |
| PDF not reading | Check file size (max 10MB default) |
