## Model Selection

### Model Comparison

| Model | Strengths | Best For |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| Claude 3.5 Sonnet | Balanced, fast | General use |
| Claude 3 Opus | Highest quality | Complex tasks |
| GPT-4 Turbo | Good reasoning | Analysis |
| Claude 3 Haiku | Fast, cheap | Simple tasks |

### Task-Based Selection

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "routing": {
      "rules": [
        {
          "pattern": "code|debug|programming",
          "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet"
        },
        {
          "pattern": "analyze|research|complex",
          "model": "claude-3-opus"
        },
        {
          "pattern": "quick|simple|remind",
          "model": "claude-3-haiku"
        }
      ],
      "default": "claude-3-5-sonnet"
    }
  }
}
```

<HostingCTA context="inline" />

## System Prompt Optimization

### Good System Prompt

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "systemPrompt": "You are a helpful AI assistant. Follow these guidelines:\n\n1. Be accurate: If unsure, say so. Don't guess.\n2. Be concise: Get to the point. Avoid filler.\n3. Be structured: Use headers, lists, and code blocks.\n4. Be actionable: Provide clear next steps.\n5. Cite sources: When referencing facts, mention where.\n\nWhen responding to code questions:\n- Show working code examples\n- Explain key concepts briefly\n- Mention potential edge cases"
  }
}
```

### Role-Specific Prompts

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "prompts": {
      "coding": "You are a senior software engineer. Provide production-ready code with error handling. Prefer modern patterns and type safety.",
      "writing": "You are a professional editor. Focus on clarity, flow, and engagement. Suggest improvements constructively.",
      "research": "You are a research analyst. Provide thorough, well-sourced answers. Acknowledge uncertainty and limitations."
    }
  }
}
```

## Temperature Settings

### Impact

```
Temperature 0.0 → Deterministic, focused, repetitive
Temperature 0.5 → Balanced, reliable, some variation
Temperature 1.0 → Creative, varied, less predictable
```

### Task-Based Temperature

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "temperature": {
      "default": 0.7,
      "overrides": {
        "code": 0.2,
        "creative": 0.9,
        "factual": 0.3,
        "chat": 0.7
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Context Optimization

### Context Window Management

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "context": {
      "maxTokens": 16000,
      "reserveForResponse": 4000,
      "prioritize": ["systemPrompt", "recentMessages", "relevantMemory"],
      "summarizeOlder": true
    }
  }
}
```

### Relevant Context Injection

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "contextInjection": {
      "rag": {
        "enabled": true,
        "topK": 3,
        "minScore": 0.7
      },
      "memory": {
        "includeRelevant": true,
        "maxItems": 5
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Output Formatting

### Format Rules

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "formatting": {
      "useMarkdown": true,
      "codeBlocks": {
        "includeLanguage": true,
        "highlightSyntax": true
      },
      "lists": {
        "preferBullets": true,
        "maxItems": 10
      },
      "length": {
        "target": "concise",
        "maxWords": 500
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Response Templates

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "templates": {
      "codeAnswer": {
        "structure": [
          "Brief explanation",
          "Code example",
          "Key points",
          "Potential issues"
        ]
      },
      "howTo": {
        "structure": [
          "Overview",
          "Prerequisites",
          "Step-by-step instructions",
          "Troubleshooting"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Quality Checks

### Response Validation

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "validation": {
      "enabled": true,
      "checks": [
        "no_hallucinated_urls",
        "code_syntax_valid",
        "answers_question",
        "within_length"
      ],
      "onFail": "regenerate"
    }
  }
}
```

### Confidence Indicators

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "confidence": {
      "showIndicator": true,
      "threshold": {
        "high": 0.9,
        "medium": 0.7,
        "low": 0.5
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Output:
```
[Confidence: High] Here's how to implement a binary search...

[Confidence: Medium] Based on my training data, the company was founded around 2015...

[Confidence: Low] I'm not certain about this specific version compatibility...
```

## Common Issues

### Verbose Responses

Problem:
```
User: What's 2+2?

Moltbot: That's a great question! Let me help you with that mathematical operation. When we add the number 2 to another number 2, we get a result of 4. This is because addition is a fundamental arithmetic operation that combines quantities...
```

Fix:
```json
{
  "agent": {
    "style": {
      "verbosity": "minimal",
      "avoidFiller": true,
      "directAnswers": true
    }
  }
}
```

Result:
```
User: What's 2+2?

Moltbot: 4
```

### Hallucination Prevention

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "accuracy": {
      "acknowledgeUncertainty": true,
      "noGuessing": true,
      "citeSources": true,
      "factCheckEnabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

### Off-Topic Responses

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "focus": {
      "stayOnTopic": true,
      "maxDigression": 1,
      "redirectToQuestion": true
    }
  }
}
```

## Quality Metrics

### Monitor Quality

```bash
moltbot quality report --days 7
```

Output:
```
📊 Quality Report (Last 7 days)

Metrics:
├─ User satisfaction: 94%
├─ Avg response length: 156 words
├─ Code accuracy: 97%
├─ Regeneration rate: 3%
└─ Timeout rate: 1%

Common Issues:
├─ Too verbose (12 cases)
├─ Missing code examples (8 cases)
└─ Slow response (5 cases)

Recommendations:
1. Lower verbosity for simple questions
2. Add code examples to coding prompts
3. Use faster model for quick queries
```

### A/B Testing

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "testing": {
      "enabled": true,
      "variants": {
        "A": { "temperature": 0.5 },
        "B": { "temperature": 0.7 }
      },
      "split": 50,
      "metrics": ["satisfaction", "accuracy", "speed"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Quick Wins

| Improvement | Effort | Impact |
|-------------|--------|--------|
| Add system prompt | Low | High |
| Lower temperature for code | Low | Medium |
| Enable RAG | Medium | High |
| Use task-based models | Medium | Medium |
| Add validation | Medium | Medium |

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Generic responses | Weak system prompt | Add specific guidelines |
| Wrong code syntax | Temperature too high | Lower to 0.2-0.3 |
| Missing context | Short memory | Increase context window |
| Slow responses | Large model | Use routing to smaller models |
| Inconsistent style | No formatting rules | Add output templates |

### Debug Quality

```bash
# View prompt being sent
moltbot chat "Hello" --debug-prompt

# Test different settings
moltbot test quality --prompt "Explain recursion" --variants temp_low,temp_high

# Check model routing
moltbot routing test "Write a Python script"
```

## Introduction

Moltbot Response Quality: Get Better AI Answers matters because it shapes how teams design reliable AI workflows and measure outcomes.
This guide explains the essentials and shows how Moltbot users can apply the ideas in a repeatable way.
You will get a clear path from prerequisites to practical steps, with examples, safeguards, and next steps.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| Node.js | 22+ (check: node --version) |
| OS | macOS, Linux, Windows (via WSL2) |
| Memory | 2GB RAM minimum (4GB+ recommended for browser automation) |
| Storage | 500MB for installation |

If you are already running Moltbot, you can skip installation and focus on configuration and workflows.

## How to apply this topic

> ⚠️ Review install scripts before running them in production. Avoid committing API keys or secrets to version control.

1. Install and onboard if you are new to the platform.
```bash
curl -fsSL https://clawd.bot/install.sh | bash
clawdbot onboard
clawdbot health
```

2. Start the gateway and confirm it is reachable locally.
```bash
clawdbot gateway --port 18789 --verbose
```

3. Connect one messaging channel and run a small workflow end-to-end.
Keep the scope small, measure latency, and expand only after you confirm stable behavior.

## Additional Notes

Moltbot workflows work best when you keep inputs tight and outputs measurable.
Define success criteria for moltbot response quality: get better ai answers before you automate anything significant.

For teams, document configuration changes and run clawdbot doctor after major edits.
This keeps the gateway stable and reduces debugging time when scaling up.

Key reminders:
- Keep tokens and passwords out of version control.
- Validate the gateway locally before exposing it.
- Roll out new skills in small batches and monitor logs.
- Re-check allow-lists after any channel changes.
