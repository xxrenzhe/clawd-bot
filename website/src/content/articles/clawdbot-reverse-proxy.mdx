# Nginx Reverse Proxy for Moltbot: SSL & Security

![Nginx Reverse Proxy for Moltbot](/images/articles/clawdbot-reverse-proxy.jpg)

## Why Use a Reverse Proxy?

| Feature | Direct Access | With Nginx |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| SSL/HTTPS | Manual setup | Let's Encrypt auto-renewal |
| Rate limiting | None | Built-in |
| Security headers | None | Configurable |
| Multiple apps | One port each | Single port 443 |
| Load balancing | None | Available |

<HostingCTA context="setup" />

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | How to Verify |
|-------------|---------------|
| Moltbot running | `moltbot gateway status` |
| VPS with public IP | Your server |
| Domain pointing to server | DNS A record |
| Root/sudo access | Required for Nginx |

## Step 1: Install Nginx

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y nginx
```

**Verify:**
```bash
sudo systemctl status nginx
```

## Step 2: Configure Moltbot for Proxy

Edit Moltbot config to bind to localhost only:

```bash
nano ~/.moltbot/moltbot.json
```

Set:
```json
{
  "gateway": {
    "bind": "loopback",
    "port": 18789,
    "trustedProxies": ["127.0.0.1"]
  }
}
```

Restart Moltbot:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart moltbot
```

## Step 3: Create Nginx Configuration

```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/moltbot
```

**Basic configuration (HTTP only for now):**
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name ai.yourdomain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:18789;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

        # Timeouts for long-running AI requests
        proxy_read_timeout 300s;
        proxy_connect_timeout 60s;
        proxy_send_timeout 300s;
    }
}
```

Enable the site:
```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/moltbot /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

## Step 4: Install SSL with Let's Encrypt

Install Certbot:
```bash
sudo apt install -y certbot python3-certbot-nginx
```

Get certificate:
```bash
sudo certbot --nginx -d ai.yourdomain.com
```

Follow the prompts. Certbot will:
1. Verify domain ownership
2. Obtain certificate
3. Configure Nginx for HTTPS
4. Set up auto-renewal

Verify auto-renewal:
```bash
sudo certbot renew --dry-run
```

## Step 5: Full Production Configuration

After SSL is set up, enhance the configuration:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/moltbot
```

**Production configuration:**
```nginx
# Rate limiting zone
limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=moltbot_limit:10m rate=10r/s;

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name ai.yourdomain.com;
    return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name ai.yourdomain.com;

    # SSL certificates (managed by Certbot)
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/ai.yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/ai.yourdomain.com/privkey.pem;
    include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf;
    ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem;

    # Security headers
    add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN" always;
    add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff" always;
    add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block" always;
    add_header Referrer-Policy "strict-origin-when-cross-origin" always;

    # Rate limiting
    limit_req zone=moltbot_limit burst=20 nodelay;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:18789;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;

        # WebSocket support
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";

        # Forward headers
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

        # Timeouts
        proxy_read_timeout 300s;
        proxy_connect_timeout 60s;
        proxy_send_timeout 300s;

        # Buffering
        proxy_buffering off;
        proxy_request_buffering off;
    }

    # Health check endpoint (no rate limit)
    location /health {
        limit_req off;
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:18789/health;
    }
}
```

Test and reload:
```bash
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

## Step 6: Configure Firewall

Allow only HTTP/HTTPS:
```bash
sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'
sudo ufw delete allow 18789  # If previously opened
sudo ufw status
```

## Step 7: Enable Authentication

Add basic auth for extra security:

```bash
sudo apt install -y apache2-utils
sudo htpasswd -c /etc/nginx/.htpasswd moltbot
```

Add to Nginx location block:
```nginx
location / {
    auth_basic "Moltbot";
    auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/.htpasswd;
    # ... rest of proxy config
}
```

## Verify Setup

Test HTTPS:
```bash
curl -I https://ai.yourdomain.com/health
```

Expected response:
```
HTTP/2 200
...
```

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| 502 Bad Gateway | Check if Moltbot is running: `moltbot gateway status` |
| SSL certificate error | Run `sudo certbot renew` |
| Permission denied | Check Nginx user can access socket |
| Timeout errors | Increase `proxy_read_timeout` |
| Rate limited | Adjust `rate=10r/s` and `burst=20` |

**View logs:**
```bash
sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log
sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log
```

**Test configuration:**
```bash
sudo nginx -t
```

## Alternative: Caddy (Simpler)

If you prefer automatic HTTPS without configuration:

```bash
sudo apt install -y caddy
```

Create `/etc/caddy/Caddyfile`:
```
ai.yourdomain.com {
    reverse_proxy localhost:18789
}
```

```bash
sudo systemctl restart caddy
```

Caddy handles SSL automatically.

## Additional Notes

Moltbot workflows work best when you keep inputs tight and outputs measurable.
Define success criteria for nginx reverse proxy for moltbot: ssl & security before you automate anything significant.

For teams, document configuration changes and run clawdbot doctor after major edits.
This keeps the gateway stable and reduces debugging time when scaling up.

Key reminders:
- Keep tokens and passwords out of version control.
- Validate the gateway locally before exposing it.
- Roll out new skills in small batches and monitor logs.
- Re-check allow-lists after any channel changes.
