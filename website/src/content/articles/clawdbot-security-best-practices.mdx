# 10 Moltbot Security Rules You Must Follow

![Moltbot Security Best Practices](/images/articles/clawdbot-security-best-practices.jpg)

## Security Model

Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot) has significant system access. Treat it as an admin tool:

| Capability | Risk Level | Mitigation |
|------------|------------|------------|
| File read/write | High | Sandbox directories |
| Shell execution | Critical | Disable in config |
| API access | Medium | Use read-only where possible |
| Message routing | Medium | Pairing mode for DMs |

<HostingCTA context="setup" />

## Quick Security Checklist

```bash
# Run security audit
moltbot doctor --security
```

- [ ] Gateway bound to loopback
- [ ] Dashboard password set
- [ ] API keys in environment variables
- [ ] DM policy set to pairing
- [ ] No port exposed to internet
- [ ] Tailscale or Cloudflare Tunnel for remote access

## Network Security

### Bind to Loopback Only

Never expose the gateway port directly:

```json
{
  "gateway": {
    "bind": "loopback",
    "port": 18789
  }
}
```

**Verify:**
```bash
netstat -tlnp | grep 18789
# Should show 127.0.0.1:18789
```

### Firewall Configuration

```bash
# Block gateway port from external access
sudo ufw deny 18789

# Verify
sudo ufw status
```

### Remote Access Options

| Method | Security | Ease of Use |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| Tailscale | Excellent | Easy |
| Cloudflare Tunnel | Excellent | Medium |
| WireGuard | Excellent | Medium |
| SSH tunnel | Good | Easy |
| Port forwarding | Poor | Easy |

**Tailscale (recommended):**
```bash
# Install
curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
sudo tailscale up

# Access via Tailscale IP
moltbot gateway status  # From any Tailscale device
```

## API Key Security

### Environment Variables

Never hardcode API keys:

```bash
# Good: Environment variable
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."

# Bad: In config file (don't do this)
# { "apiKey": "sk-ant-..." }
```

### Secure Storage Options

| Method | Security | Complexity |
|--------|----------|------------|
| Environment variables | Good | Low |
| Encrypted file | Better | Medium |
| Secret manager (1Password CLI, Vault) | Best | High |

**Using 1Password CLI:**
```bash
# Store secret
op item create --category=login --title="Moltbot API Key" \
  password="sk-ant-..."

# Retrieve at runtime
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=$(op read "op://Private/Moltbot API Key/password")
```

### Key Rotation

Rotate keys regularly:

1. Generate new key at console.anthropic.com
2. Update environment variable
3. Restart Moltbot
4. Delete old key

## Access Control

### Dashboard Authentication

```json
{
  "gateway": {
    "auth": {
      "password": "strong-random-password-here"
    }
  }
}
```

Generate strong password:
```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

### DM Policy

Control who can message your bot:

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "telegram": {
      "dmPolicy": "pairing"
    }
  }
}
```

| Policy | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| `open` | Anyone can DM (not recommended) |
| `pairing` | Requires approval code |
| `allowlist` | Only specific user IDs |

### Tool Sandboxing

Limit what the AI can do:

```json
{
  "security": {
    "sandbox": {
      "allowedTools": ["web-search", "calculator", "weather"],
      "deniedTools": ["shell", "file-write"],
      "allowedPaths": ["~/.moltbot/files/"],
      "deniedPaths": ["~/.ssh", "~/.gnupg"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Audit Logging

Enable comprehensive logging:

```json
{
  "logging": {
    "level": "info",
    "auditLog": {
      "enabled": true,
      "path": "~/.moltbot/logs/audit.log",
      "events": ["tool_execution", "api_call", "auth_attempt"]
    }
  }
}
```

Review logs:
```bash
# Recent activity
tail -f ~/.moltbot/logs/audit.log | jq

# Search for specific events
grep "tool_execution" ~/.moltbot/logs/audit.log | jq
```

## Data Privacy

### What Data Is Sent

| Data | Destination | Can Disable |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| Messages | Claude API | No (required) |
| Tool results | Claude API | No (required) |
| Telemetry | Anthropic | Yes |
| Crash reports | Moltbot | Yes |

### Disable Telemetry

```json
{
  "telemetry": {
    "enabled": false,
    "crashReports": false
  }
}
```

### Local Processing

Use local models for sensitive data:

```json
{
  "provider": "ollama",
  "model": "llama3",
  "ollama": {
    "baseUrl": "http://localhost:11434"
  }
}
```

## Isolation Options

For maximum security:

### Dedicated User Account

```bash
# Create dedicated user
sudo adduser moltbot --system --group

# Set ownership
sudo chown -R moltbot:moltbot /home/moltbot/.moltbot

# Run as moltbot user
sudo -u moltbot moltbot gateway
```

### Docker Isolation

```yaml
services:
  moltbot:
    image: moltbot/moltbot:latest
    user: "1000:1000"
    read_only: true
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:true
    cap_drop:
      - ALL
    volumes:
      - ./config:/home/moltbot/.moltbot:ro
      - ./data:/home/moltbot/.moltbot/data
```

### VM or Dedicated Machine

For highest security:
- Fresh OS installation
- Dedicated machine or VM
- No other services running
- Regular security updates

## Common Vulnerabilities

### Prompt Injection

The AI might be tricked into executing commands:

```json
{
  "security": {
    "promptInjectionProtection": true,
    "validateToolInputs": true
  }
}
```

### API Key Exposure

Check for accidental exposure:
```bash
# Search for keys in files
grep -r "sk-ant-" ~/.moltbot/ --include="*.json"

# Check git history
git log -p | grep "sk-ant-"
```

### Insecure Defaults

Review and change all defaults:
```bash
moltbot doctor --security
```

## Security Updates

Stay updated:
```bash
# Check for updates
moltbot update --check

# Update
brew upgrade moltbot  # or npm update -g moltbot

# View changelog
moltbot changelog
```

## Incident Response

If you suspect a breach:

1. **Stop the gateway:** `moltbot gateway stop`
2. **Rotate all API keys** immediately
3. **Review audit logs:** `grep "unusual" ~/.moltbot/logs/audit.log`
4. **Revoke bot tokens** (Telegram, Discord)
5. **Check for unauthorized access**

## Introduction

10 Moltbot Security Rules You Must Follow matters because it shapes how teams design reliable AI workflows and measure outcomes.
This guide explains the essentials and shows how Moltbot users can apply the ideas in a repeatable way.
You will get a clear path from prerequisites to practical steps, with examples, safeguards, and next steps.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| Node.js | 22+ (check: node --version) |
| OS | macOS, Linux, Windows (via WSL2) |
| Memory | 2GB RAM minimum (4GB+ recommended for browser automation) |
| Storage | 500MB for installation |

If you are already running Moltbot, you can skip installation and focus on configuration and workflows.

## How to apply this topic

> ⚠️ Review install scripts before running them in production. Avoid committing API keys or secrets to version control.

1. Install and onboard if you are new to the platform.
```bash
curl -fsSL https://clawd.bot/install.sh | bash
clawdbot onboard
clawdbot health
```

2. Start the gateway and confirm it is reachable locally.
```bash
clawdbot gateway --port 18789 --verbose
```

3. Connect one messaging channel and run a small workflow end-to-end.
Keep the scope small, measure latency, and expand only after you confirm stable behavior.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|---|---|
| Command not found | Ensure Node.js 22+ is installed and your PATH is updated. |
| Gateway not reachable | Confirm the gateway is bound to loopback and port 18789 is free. |
| Auth errors | Verify API keys and rotate them if they may be exposed. |
| Slow responses | Reduce active skills, test a smaller model, and review logs. |
| Messages not delivered | Re-check channel tokens and allow-lists. |

## Additional Notes

Moltbot workflows work best when you keep inputs tight and outputs measurable.
Define success criteria for 10 moltbot security rules you must follow before you automate anything significant.

For teams, document configuration changes and run clawdbot doctor after major edits.
This keeps the gateway stable and reduces debugging time when scaling up.

Key reminders:
- Keep tokens and passwords out of version control.
- Validate the gateway locally before exposing it.
- Roll out new skills in small batches and monitor logs.
- Re-check allow-lists after any channel changes.
