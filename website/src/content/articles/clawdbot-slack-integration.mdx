# Moltbot + Slack: AI Bot in 5 Minutes

![Moltbot Slack Integration](/images/articles/clawdbot-slack-integration.jpg)

## What You'll Build

A Slack bot powered by Claude that:
- Responds to mentions and DMs
- Uses slash commands (`/ask`, `/summarize`)
- Works in specific channels
- Integrates with your workspace tools

<HostingCTA context="setup" />

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| Moltbot installed | `moltbot health` |
| Slack workspace | Admin access for app creation |
| Public URL or tunnel | For Slack events |

## Step 1: Create Slack App

1. Go to [api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps)
2. Click "Create New App"
3. Choose "From scratch"
4. Name: "Moltbot" (or your preference)
5. Select your workspace
6. Click "Create App"

## Step 2: Configure Bot User

1. Go to "OAuth & Permissions"
2. Add these Bot Token Scopes:

| Scope | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `app_mentions:read` | Respond to @mentions |
| `chat:write` | Send messages |
| `channels:history` | Read channel messages |
| `groups:history` | Read private channel messages |
| `im:history` | Read DMs |
| `im:write` | Send DMs |
| `users:read` | Get user info |
| `commands` | Slash commands |

3. Click "Install to Workspace"
4. Authorize the app
5. Copy the "Bot User OAuth Token" (starts with `xoxb-`)

## Step 3: Set Up Event Subscriptions

1. Go to "Event Subscriptions"
2. Toggle "Enable Events" on
3. Request URL: `https://your-domain/slack/events`
   - If no public URL, use Cloudflare Tunnel or ngrok
4. Subscribe to bot events:
   - `app_mention`
   - `message.channels`
   - `message.groups`
   - `message.im`
5. Save Changes

<HostingCTA context="inline" />

## Step 4: Configure Moltbot

Add Slack token:
```bash
export SLACK_BOT_TOKEN="xoxb-..."
export SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET="your-signing-secret"
```

Get signing secret from "Basic Information" → "App Credentials"

Configure:
```bash
moltbot configure --section channels.slack
```

Or edit config directly:
```json
{
  "channels": {
    "slack": {
      "enabled": true,
      "token": "${SLACK_BOT_TOKEN}",
      "signingSecret": "${SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET}",
      "allowedWorkspaces": ["T0123456789"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Step 5: Set Up Slash Commands

1. Go to "Slash Commands" in Slack app settings
2. Create commands:

| Command | URL | Description |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| `/ask` | `https://your-domain/slack/commands` | Ask the AI a question |
| `/summarize` | `https://your-domain/slack/commands` | Summarize conversation |
| `/skill` | `https://your-domain/slack/commands` | Run a skill |

## Step 6: Start Gateway

```bash
moltbot gateway
```

Or with systemd:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart moltbot
```

## Step 7: Test the Bot

In Slack:
1. Mention the bot: `@Moltbot What's the weather today?`
2. Use slash command: `/ask What is the capital of France?`
3. DM the bot directly

## Interaction Modes

### Mentions
```
@Moltbot summarize the last 10 messages
```

### Slash Commands
```
/ask What's the status of project X?
/summarize
/skill github "check my PRs"
```

### DMs
Direct messages work automatically after adding the bot.

### Thread Replies
```
[In a thread]
@Moltbot can you explain this further?
```

## Channel Configuration

### Active Channels

Bot responds to all messages (not just mentions):
```json
{
  "channels": {
    "slack": {
      "activeChannels": ["C0123456789", "C9876543210"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Channel-Specific Settings

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "slack": {
      "channelConfigs": {
        "C0123456789": {
          "systemPrompt": "You are a helpful dev team assistant.",
          "enabledSkills": ["github", "jira"]
        },
        "C9876543210": {
          "systemPrompt": "You are a customer support assistant.",
          "enabledSkills": ["zendesk", "knowledge-base"]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Workspace Permissions

### Restrict to Specific Channels

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "slack": {
      "allowedChannels": ["C0123456789"],
      "denyDMs": false
    }
  }
}
```

### Admin-Only Commands

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "slack": {
      "adminUsers": ["U0123456789"],
      "adminOnlySkills": ["shell", "file-write"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Rich Messages

Moltbot can send formatted Slack messages:

```
You: /ask Show me the server status

Moltbot:
┌──────────────────────────────┐
│ Server Status                │
├──────────────────────────────┤
│ ✅ API: Healthy              │
│ ✅ Database: Connected       │
│ ⚠️  Cache: High latency      │
└──────────────────────────────┘
```

## Slack Connect (External Workspaces)

For shared channels with partners:

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "slack": {
      "allowSlackConnect": true,
      "externalPolicy": "readonly"
    }
  }
}
```

## Security Considerations

| Setting | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|
| Signing secret | Always verify (enabled by default) |
| Token scope | Minimum required |
| Channel access | Restrict to needed channels |
| DM policy | Consider `pairing` mode |

### Verify Request Signatures

Moltbot verifies all incoming requests using the signing secret. Never disable this.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Bot doesn't respond | Check Event Subscriptions URL is verified |
| "Invalid request signature" | Verify signing secret is correct |
| Slash commands not working | Check Request URL is accessible |
| Missing messages | Verify bot is in the channel |
| Rate limited | Slack has 1 message/second limit per channel |

**Test webhook:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-domain/slack/events \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type":"url_verification","challenge":"test"}'
```

**View logs:**
```bash
moltbot logs --channel slack
```

## Example Workflows

### Daily Standup Summary
```
/summarize #standup from yesterday
```

### Project Research
```
@Moltbot research competitor pricing for project-alpha
```

### Code Review Request
```
@Moltbot review PR #123 on our-repo and summarize changes
```

## Additional Notes

Moltbot workflows work best when you keep inputs tight and outputs measurable.
Define success criteria for moltbot + slack: ai bot in 5 minutes before you automate anything significant.

For teams, document configuration changes and run clawdbot doctor after major edits.
This keeps the gateway stable and reduces debugging time when scaling up.

Key reminders:
- Keep tokens and passwords out of version control.
- Validate the gateway locally before exposing it.
- Roll out new skills in small batches and monitor logs.
- Re-check allow-lists after any channel changes.
