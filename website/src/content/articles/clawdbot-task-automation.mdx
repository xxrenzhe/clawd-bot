## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Automation not running | Check gateway is running 24/7 |
| Wrong timezone | Set `timezone` in automation config |
| Trigger not firing | Verify conditions match exactly |
| Workflow failing | Check logs: `moltbot logs --filter automations` |

**Debug mode:**
```bash
moltbot automations list --verbose
moltbot automations test morning_briefing
```

## Security Considerations

| Setting | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|
| Shell commands | Use allowlist, sandbox |
| File access | Limit to specific paths |
| Email sending | Require confirmation |
| External APIs | Use least privilege tokens |

## Introduction

5 Moltbot Automations You Can Copy Today matters because it shapes how teams design reliable AI workflows and measure outcomes.
This guide explains the essentials and shows how Moltbot users can apply the ideas in a repeatable way.
You will get a clear path from prerequisites to practical steps, with examples, safeguards, and next steps.

## How to apply this topic

> ⚠️ Review install scripts before running them in production. Avoid committing API keys or secrets to version control.

1. Install and onboard if you are new to the platform.
```bash
curl -fsSL https://clawd.bot/install.sh | bash
clawdbot onboard
clawdbot health
```

2. Start the gateway and confirm it is reachable locally.
```bash
clawdbot gateway --port 18789 --verbose
```

3. Connect one messaging channel and run a small workflow end-to-end.
Keep the scope small, measure latency, and expand only after you confirm stable behavior.

## Additional Notes

Moltbot workflows work best when you keep inputs tight and outputs measurable.
Define success criteria for 5 moltbot automations you can copy today before you automate anything significant.

For teams, document configuration changes and run clawdbot doctor after major edits.
This keeps the gateway stable and reduces debugging time when scaling up.

Key reminders:
- Keep tokens and passwords out of version control.
- Validate the gateway locally before exposing it.
- Roll out new skills in small batches and monitor logs.
- Re-check allow-lists after any channel changes.
