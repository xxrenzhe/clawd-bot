## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Automation not running | Check gateway is running 24/7 |
| Wrong timezone | Set `timezone` in automation config |
| Trigger not firing | Verify conditions match exactly |
| Workflow failing | Check logs: `moltbot logs --filter automations` |

**Debug mode:**
```bash
moltbot automations list --verbose
moltbot automations test morning_briefing
```

## Security Considerations

| Setting | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|
| Shell commands | Use allowlist, sandbox |
| File access | Limit to specific paths |
| Email sending | Require confirmation |
| External APIs | Use least privilege tokens |
