# Automating Tasks with Clawdbot Complete Guide

![Automating Tasks with Clawdbot Complete Guide](/images/articles/clawdbot-task-automation.jpg)

## Introduction
Clawdbot is an Open-source, self-hosted personal AI assistant that acts as an AI Gateway and connects messaging apps to LLM APIs like Claude. This article covers Automating Tasks with Clawdbot Complete Guide with verified commands, safe defaults, and clear steps you can follow on your own hardware. API stands for application programming interface, and the Clawdbot CLI (command line interface) is how you run setup commands from your terminal.

## What You'll Learn
- Install Clawdbot using verified commands and confirm the gateway is healthy.
- Configure API keys and secure access without exposing the gateway port.
- Connect messaging channels such as Telegram and Discord.
- Apply best practices and troubleshoot common issues.

## Overview
This guide explains Automating Tasks with Clawdbot Complete Guide using verified Clawdbot commands and safe defaults. It focuses on repeatable workflows that work across macOS, Linux, and Windows via WSL2.

## Key Concepts
- Gateway: Central hub that connects messaging platforms and orchestrates interactions. Acts as a switchboard channeling messages to the AI.
- Agent: The "brain" powered by LLMs like Claude or GPT. Responsible for context, memory, and reasoning. Operates in RPC mode.
- Skills: Optional extensions providing capabilities beyond basic chat. Defined in markdown files (~/clawd/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md).
- Memory: Persistent, file-based system storing conversations, preferences, and context as actual files.

## Getting Started
Start by confirming Node.js 22++ and running clawdbot onboard. This creates a baseline configuration you can refine later.

## Best Practices
Follow these practices to keep your setup reliable and secure:
- Bind gateway.bind to "loopback" to prevent external exposure
- Use "pairing" mode for DM policy to manually approve devices
- Configure gateway.auth.password for authentication
- Configure gateway.trustedProxies for reverse proxy setups
- Sandbox tools for group chats

## Common Pitfalls
- Node.js version too old: Upgrade to Node.js 22+: nvm install 22 && nvm use 22.
- Permission denied during installation: Use sudo for global install or fix npm permissions.
- Gateway fails to start: Check port 18789 availability, verify API keys are set.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 22++ (node --version)
- Supported OS: macOS, Linux, Windows (via WSL2)
- Memory: 2GB RAM minimum (4GB+ recommended for browser automation)
- Storage: 500MB for installation
Install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) if needed, then confirm your version before continuing.

## Step 1: Install and Verify Clawdbot
Use the official installer or the npm alternative. For example, the installer script is the fastest option when you are starting fresh.
> Warning: Piping a script to bash can be risky. Review the script first and never expose the gateway port to the public internet.
```bash
curl -fsSL https://clawd.bot/install.sh | bash
clawdbot onboard
clawdbot health
```
Step 1: Run the installer and confirm Node.js 22+ is available.
Step 2: Use the onboarding wizard to configure your providers.
Step 3: Run the health check to verify the gateway.

## Step 2: Configure Secure Access
Keep API keys secret, avoid committing them to git, and store them in environment variables or secure config files. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, and you can store configuration there when needed.
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key-here"
export DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN="your-token-here"
clawdbot doctor
```
If you are using a reverse proxy, configure gateway.auth.password and gateway.trustedProxies for safety.

## Step 3: Connect Messaging Channels
Telegram is the easiest starting point, and Discord is a popular next step. Follow the verified setup steps and keep bot tokens private.
```bash
clawdbot configure --section channels.telegram
clawdbot configure --section channels.discord
```
Once channels are connected, test a simple message to ensure routing works end to end.

<HostingCTA context="inline" />

## Verification
Start the gateway and confirm the local dashboard is reachable on the default port.
```bash
clawdbot gateway --port 18789 --verbose
clawdbot gateway status
```
If the dashboard does not load, check the port and validate your API keys.

## Troubleshooting
- Node.js version too old: Upgrade to Node.js 22+: nvm install 22 && nvm use 22.
- Permission denied during installation: Use sudo for global install or fix npm permissions.
- Gateway fails to start: Check port 18789 availability, verify API keys are set.
- Telegram/Discord bot token invalid: Regenerate token from BotFather or Discord Developer Portal.
If issues persist, run the doctor command again and review the official docs.

## Security Notes
Clawdbot can have deep system access, so treat it like an admin tool.
- Bind gateway.bind to "loopback" to prevent external exposure
- Configure gateway.auth.password for authentication
- Use Tailscale or Cloudflare Tunnel for remote access (never expose ports directly)
Never share API keys or expose the gateway port to the public internet.

## Additional Notes
Clawdbot runs well on a modern laptop, a Mac Mini for 24/7 operation, a Raspberry Pi for low power, or a small VPS for remote access. Choose the footprint that matches your uptime, latency, and privacy needs.

## Use Cases
- Email management and automation (Gmail API integration)
- Calendar scheduling and reminders (Google Calendar)
- Smart home control (Philips Hue, Sonos, thermostat)
- Code review and development assistance
- Web research and information gathering
- Content generation (images, videos, text)
- DevOps monitoring (Sentry, GitHub, CI/CD pipelines)
- Customer support automation
- Meeting notes and transcription
- Crypto market monitoring and price alerts
- Morning briefings and daily digests
- Browser automation and web scraping
- PDF summarization and file organization
- Pull request creation and test running

## Deployment Options
- Local Machine: Run on your laptop or desktop. Pros: Easy setup, Direct access. Cons: Not 24/7 unless always on.
- Mac Mini M4: Recommended for 24/7 home operation. Pros: Always on, Low power, Great performance, Supports iMessage. Cons: Hardware cost (~$599+).
- Raspberry Pi 4/5: Low-cost always-on option. Pros: Very low cost (~$35-80), Low power, Always on. Cons: Limited performance, No true sleep state.
- VPS/Cloud: Cloud deployment on providers like Hetzner, DigitalOcean, AWS. Pros: 24/7 availability, Reliable, Remote access. Cons: Monthly cost ($5+), Requires cloud knowledge.
- Docker: Containerized deployment (recommended for self-hosting). Pros: Isolated, Portable, Easy updates. Cons: Docker knowledge required.

## Configuration Checklist
- Confirm Node.js 22++ and verify with "node --version".
- Run "clawdbot onboard" and store configuration in clawdbot.json.
- Set API keys in environment variables or a secure secret manager.
- Bind the gateway to loopback and set a strong dashboard password.
- Run "clawdbot doctor" and fix any reported issues.

## Channel Setup Highlights
Telegram essentials:
- Open Telegram and search for @BotFather
- Start a chat and run /newbot command
- Follow prompts to name your bot (must end in "bot")
- Copy the bot token provided by BotFather
Discord essentials:
- Go to Discord Developer Portal: https://discord.com/developers/applications
- Create a new application
- Navigate to "Bot" section and click "Add Bot"
- Click "Reset Token" to get your bot token

## Security Checklist

- Read security documentation thoroughly before connecting to personal accounts
- Start with sandboxed environment and principle of least privilege
- Use dedicated email account, not personal/work
- Consider reformatted hard drive for maximum isolation
- Use fresh OS installation for sensitive deployments
- Run clawdbot doctor to check security configuration
- Keep separate CLI tool on host for troubleshooting Docker issues
Never expose the gateway port to the public internet.

## Extended Notes
Clawdbot rewards careful iteration. Start with a minimal configuration, validate the gateway, and expand features one change at a time. This reduces risk and makes troubleshooting faster.

Operationally, plan for log review, backups, and update windows. For example, schedule a weekly check of gateway status and a monthly review of API key hygiene.

If you are deploying for a team, document the onboarding flow and store configuration in version control without secrets. Keep a backup of clawdbot.json so you can restore quickly.

Operational checklist:
- Verify the gateway is bound to loopback.
- Confirm dashboard authentication is enabled.
- Review messaging allow-lists and bot tokens.
- Run clawdbot doctor after any major change.
