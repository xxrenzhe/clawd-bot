```

## Best Practices

### Security

| Practice | Implementation |
|----------|----------------|
| Principle of least privilege | Start with minimal permissions |
| Regular audits | Review logs weekly |
| Key rotation | Rotate API keys monthly |
| Exit process | Remove users promptly |

### Onboarding

1. Create user with minimal role
2. Provide training on allowed tools
3. Monitor initial usage
4. Adjust permissions as needed

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| User can't access | Wrong role | Check permissions |
| Skill not visible | Scope mismatch | Set scope to team |
| Audit missing events | Not configured | Enable in config |
| Rate limited | Too many users | Increase limits |

## Introduction

Moltbot Team Collaboration: Multi-User Setup matters because it shapes how teams design reliable AI workflows and measure outcomes.
This guide explains the essentials and shows how Moltbot users can apply the ideas in a repeatable way.
You will get a clear path from prerequisites to practical steps, with examples, safeguards, and next steps.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| Node.js | 22+ (check: node --version) |
| OS | macOS, Linux, Windows (via WSL2) |
| Memory | 2GB RAM minimum (4GB+ recommended for browser automation) |
| Storage | 500MB for installation |

If you are already running Moltbot, you can skip installation and focus on configuration and workflows.

## How to apply this topic

> ⚠️ Review install scripts before running them in production. Avoid committing API keys or secrets to version control.

1. Install and onboard if you are new to the platform.
```bash
curl -fsSL https://clawd.bot/install.sh | bash
clawdbot onboard
clawdbot health
```

2. Start the gateway and confirm it is reachable locally.
```bash
clawdbot gateway --port 18789 --verbose
```

3. Connect one messaging channel and run a small workflow end-to-end.
Keep the scope small, measure latency, and expand only after you confirm stable behavior.

## Additional Notes

Moltbot workflows work best when you keep inputs tight and outputs measurable.
Define success criteria for moltbot team collaboration: multi-user setup before you automate anything significant.

For teams, document configuration changes and run clawdbot doctor after major edits.
This keeps the gateway stable and reduces debugging time when scaling up.

Key reminders:
- Keep tokens and passwords out of version control.
- Validate the gateway locally before exposing it.
- Roll out new skills in small batches and monitor logs.
- Re-check allow-lists after any channel changes.
