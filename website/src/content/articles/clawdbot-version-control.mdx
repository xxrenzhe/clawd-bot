# Moltbot Config Version Control: Git Best Practices

![Moltbot Version Control](/images/articles/clawdbot-version-control.jpg)

## What to Version Control

| Include | Exclude |
|---------|---------|
| moltbot.json | .env files |
| skills/*.js | *.key files |
| prompts/ | secrets.json |
| docker-compose.yml | memory.db |

<HostingCTA context="setup" />

## Repository Structure

```

├── .gitignore
├── README.md
├── config/

## .gitignore

```gitignore
# Secrets - NEVER commit these
.env
.env.*
secrets.json
*.key
*.pem

# Runtime data
memory/
data/
logs/
*.db
*.sqlite

# Cache
.cache/
node_modules/

# OS files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
```

## Secret Management

### Environment Variables

```json
// moltbot.json - reference env vars
{
  "agent": {
    "apiKey": "${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}"
  },
  "channels": {
    "telegram": {
      "token": "${TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN}"
    }
  }
}
```

### .env.example

Commit a template:

```bash
# .env.example (committed)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-key-here
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=123456:ABC-your-token
GATEWAY_PASSWORD=change-this-password
```

### Secret Providers

```json
{
  "secrets": {
    "provider": "vault",
    "config": {
      "address": "https://vault.example.com",
      "path": "secret/moltbot"
    }
  }
}
```

## Environment Configs

### Base + Override Pattern

```json
// config/moltbot.json (base)
{
  "agent": {
    "provider": "anthropic",
    "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514"
  },
  "gateway": {
    "bind": "loopback"
  }
}
```

```json
// config/moltbot.prod.json (override)
{
  "extends": "./moltbot.json",
  "gateway": {
    "bind": "0.0.0.0",
    "workers": 4
  }
}
```

### Deployment

```bash
# Development
moltbot gateway --config config/moltbot.dev.json

# Production
moltbot gateway --config config/moltbot.prod.json
```

## Git Workflow

### Branch Strategy

| Branch | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `main` | Production config |
| `develop` | Staging config |
| `feature/*` | New skills/configs |

### Pull Request Template

```markdown
## Config Change

### What changed
- Updated system prompt for code review skill

### Testing
- [ ] Tested in development
- [ ] No secrets committed
- [ ] Config validation passed

### Rollback
Previous commit: abc1234
```

## Validation

### Pre-commit Hook

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# .git/hooks/pre-commit

# Check for secrets
if git diff --cached | grep -E "(sk-ant-|API_KEY=)" > /dev/null; then
  echo "ERROR: Potential secret detected!"
  exit 1
fi

# Validate config
moltbot config validate || exit 1
```

### CI Validation

```yaml
# .github/workflows/validate.yml
name: Validate Config
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  validate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Install Moltbot
        run: npm install -g moltbot

      - name: Validate configs
        run: |
          moltbot config validate config/moltbot.json
          moltbot config validate config/moltbot.prod.json

      - name: Check for secrets
        run: |
          if grep -r "sk-ant-" . --include="*.json"; then
            echo "Secrets found!"
            exit 1
          fi
```

## Deployment Automation

### Deploy Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/deploy.sh

set -e

# Pull latest config
git pull origin main

# Validate
moltbot config validate config/moltbot.prod.json

# Backup current state
moltbot backup create

# Apply new config
moltbot config apply config/moltbot.prod.json

# Restart gateway
moltbot gateway restart

# Verify
moltbot health
```

### Rollback

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/rollback.sh

PREVIOUS_COMMIT=$1

git checkout $PREVIOUS_COMMIT -- config/
moltbot config apply config/moltbot.prod.json
moltbot gateway restart
```

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Secret committed | Not in .gitignore | Rotate secret, update .gitignore |
| Config conflict | Merge issue | Review both versions carefully |
| Validation fails | Schema change | Update config to new format |
| Deploy fails | Missing env var | Check environment configuration |

## Introduction

Moltbot Config Version Control: Git Best Practices matters because it shapes how teams design reliable AI workflows and measure outcomes.
This guide explains the essentials and shows how Moltbot users can apply the ideas in a repeatable way.
You will get a clear path from prerequisites to practical steps, with examples, safeguards, and next steps.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| Node.js | 22+ (check: node --version) |
| OS | macOS, Linux, Windows (via WSL2) |
| Memory | 2GB RAM minimum (4GB+ recommended for browser automation) |
| Storage | 500MB for installation |

If you are already running Moltbot, you can skip installation and focus on configuration and workflows.

## How to apply this topic

> ⚠️ Review install scripts before running them in production. Avoid committing API keys or secrets to version control.

1. Install and onboard if you are new to the platform.
```bash
curl -fsSL https://clawd.bot/install.sh | bash
clawdbot onboard
clawdbot health
```

2. Start the gateway and confirm it is reachable locally.
```bash
clawdbot gateway --port 18789 --verbose
```

3. Connect one messaging channel and run a small workflow end-to-end.
Keep the scope small, measure latency, and expand only after you confirm stable behavior.

## Additional Notes

Moltbot workflows work best when you keep inputs tight and outputs measurable.
Define success criteria for moltbot config version control: git best practices before you automate anything significant.

For teams, document configuration changes and run clawdbot doctor after major edits.
This keeps the gateway stable and reduces debugging time when scaling up.

Key reminders:
- Keep tokens and passwords out of version control.
- Validate the gateway locally before exposing it.
- Roll out new skills in small batches and monitor logs.
- Re-check allow-lists after any channel changes.
