# Deploy Moltbot on VPS: Hetzner, DigitalOcean Guide

![Deploying Moltbot on VPS](/images/articles/clawdbot-vps-deployment.jpg)

## VPS Provider Comparison

| Provider | Cheapest Plan | Location | Best For |
|----------|---------------|----------|----------|
| Hetzner | €3.79/mo (2GB) | EU, US | Best value |
| DigitalOcean | $6/mo (1GB) | Global | Easy setup |
| Linode | $5/mo (1GB) | Global | Good support |
| Vultr | $5/mo (1GB) | Global | Hourly billing |
| Oracle Cloud | Free (1GB) | Limited | Free tier |

**Recommended:** Hetzner CX22 (2 vCPU, 4GB RAM) for €5.39/mo — best performance per euro.

## Step 1: Create VPS Instance

### Hetzner Cloud

1. Go to [console.hetzner.cloud](https://console.hetzner.cloud)
2. Create new project → Add Server
3. Choose:
   - **Image:** Ubuntu 24.04
   - **Type:** CX22 (or CX11 for budget)
   - **Location:** Closest to you
   - **SSH Key:** Add your public key
4. Create Server

### DigitalOcean

1. Go to [cloud.digitalocean.com](https://cloud.digitalocean.com)
2. Create Droplet
3. Choose:
   - **Image:** Ubuntu 24.04
   - **Plan:** Basic $6/mo (1GB) or $12/mo (2GB)
   - **Region:** Closest to you
   - **SSH Key:** Add your public key
4. Create Droplet

## Step 2: Initial Server Setup

SSH into your server:
```bash
ssh root@your-server-ip
```

Create a non-root user:
```bash
adduser moltbot
usermod -aG sudo moltbot
```

Copy SSH key to new user:
```bash
rsync --archive --chown=moltbot:moltbot ~/.ssh /home/moltbot
```

Switch to new user:
```bash
su - moltbot
```

Update system:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

## Step 3: Configure Firewall

```bash
sudo ufw allow OpenSSH
sudo ufw enable
```

**Do NOT open port 18789** — we'll use Cloudflare Tunnel for secure access.

## Step 4: Install Node.js 22

```bash
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_22.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

Verify:
```bash
node --version  # Should show v22.x
```

## Step 5: Install Moltbot

```bash
curl -fsSL https://molt.bot/install.sh | bash
```

Run setup:
```bash
moltbot onboard
```

Get your API key from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com).

## Step 6: Create systemd Service

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/moltbot.service
```

Paste:
```ini
[Unit]
Description=Moltbot AI Gateway
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=moltbot
Environment=ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-key-here
ExecStart=/usr/bin/moltbot gateway
Restart=always
RestartSec=10
StandardOutput=journal
StandardError=journal

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Enable and start:
```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable moltbot
sudo systemctl start moltbot
```

Check status:
```bash
sudo systemctl status moltbot
```

## Step 7: Set Up Cloudflare Tunnel (Recommended)

Cloudflare Tunnel provides secure access without exposing ports.

### Install cloudflared

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-linux-amd64.deb -o cloudflared.deb
sudo dpkg -i cloudflared.deb
```

### Authenticate

```bash
cloudflared tunnel login
```

### Create tunnel

```bash
cloudflared tunnel create moltbot
cloudflared tunnel route dns moltbot ai.yourdomain.com
```

### Configure tunnel

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.cloudflared
nano ~/.cloudflared/config.yml
```

Paste:
```yaml
tunnel: moltbot
credentials-file: /home/moltbot/.cloudflared/TUNNEL-ID.json

ingress:
  - hostname: ai.yourdomain.com
    service: http://localhost:18789
  - service: http_status:404
```

### Run as service

```bash
sudo cloudflared service install
sudo systemctl start cloudflared
```

Now access Moltbot at `https://ai.yourdomain.com`

## Alternative: Tailscale (Simpler)

If you don't need public access:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
sudo tailscale up
```

Access your VPS via its Tailscale IP from any device on your Tailscale network.

## Connect Telegram

```bash
moltbot configure --section channels.telegram
```

1. Open Telegram, search for @BotFather
2. Send `/newbot`, follow prompts
3. Copy the token when prompted

Restart the service:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart moltbot
```

## Monitoring

View logs:
```bash
sudo journalctl -u moltbot -f
```

Check health:
```bash
moltbot health
```

Set up log rotation (automatic with journald).

## Security Checklist

- [ ] Non-root user created
- [ ] SSH key authentication (disable password login)
- [ ] UFW firewall enabled
- [ ] Port 18789 NOT exposed publicly
- [ ] Cloudflare Tunnel or Tailscale for access
- [ ] API keys in environment variables
- [ ] Regular system updates

**Disable password login:**
```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
# Set: PasswordAuthentication no
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

## Cost Analysis

| Component | Monthly Cost |
|-----------|--------------|
| Hetzner CX22 (4GB) | €5.39 |
| Claude API (personal) | $5-20 |
| Domain (optional) | ~$1 |
| **Total** | ~$12-27/mo |

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Service won't start | Check `journalctl -u moltbot -e` for errors |
| Can't SSH | Check firewall: `sudo ufw status` |
| High memory usage | Upgrade to 2GB+ VPS |
| Tunnel not working | Verify `cloudflared tunnel list` shows your tunnel |

**Restart everything:**
```bash
sudo systemctl restart moltbot
sudo systemctl restart cloudflared
```

## Introduction

Deploy Moltbot on VPS for $5/month matters because it shapes how teams design reliable AI workflows and measure outcomes.
This guide explains the essentials and shows how Moltbot users can apply the ideas in a repeatable way.
You will get a clear path from prerequisites to practical steps, with examples, safeguards, and next steps.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| Node.js | 22+ (check: node --version) |
| OS | macOS, Linux, Windows (via WSL2) |
| Memory | 2GB RAM minimum (4GB+ recommended for browser automation) |
| Storage | 500MB for installation |

If you are already running Moltbot, you can skip installation and focus on configuration and workflows.

## Additional Notes

Moltbot workflows work best when you keep inputs tight and outputs measurable.
Define success criteria for deploy moltbot on vps for $5/month before you automate anything significant.

For teams, document configuration changes and run clawdbot doctor after major edits.
This keeps the gateway stable and reduces debugging time when scaling up.

Key reminders:
- Keep tokens and passwords out of version control.
- Validate the gateway locally before exposing it.
- Roll out new skills in small batches and monitor logs.
- Re-check allow-lists after any channel changes.
