## Use Case Comparison

### Customer Support Bot

**Botpress (ideal choice):**
- Visual flow: Greeting → Problem type → Solution
- Intent training: "My order is late" → shipping_issue
- Handoff: Escalate to human agent
- Analytics: Track resolution rates

**Moltbot (not ideal):**
- Would work but lacks customer-facing features
- No built-in analytics or handoff
- Better for internal use

### Personal AI Assistant

**Moltbot (ideal choice):**
```
User: "Summarize my emails and add the meeting to calendar"
Moltbot: [Reads emails, summarizes, adds calendar event]
```
Personal productivity, messaging access.

**Botpress (not ideal):**
- Overkill for personal use
- Flow-based design doesn't fit open-ended requests
- No native Telegram/Discord

## When to Choose Each

**Choose Botpress if:**
- Building a customer support chatbot
- Non-technical team members need to contribute
- You need conversation analytics
- Intent-based flows match your use case
- Enterprise features (SSO, audit) are required

**Choose Moltbot if:**
- You want a personal AI assistant
- Messaging apps are your interface
- You prefer LLM reasoning over intent matching
- Developer comfort with CLI/config
- LLM flexibility matters

## Different Problems, Different Solutions

Botpress and Moltbot rarely compete directly:
- **Botpress** for external, customer-facing chatbots
- **Moltbot** for internal, personal AI assistants

Some organizations use both.

## Try Moltbot

## Introduction

Botpress vs Moltbot: Enterprise Chatbot Comparison matters because it shapes how teams design reliable AI workflows and measure outcomes.
This guide explains the essentials and shows how Moltbot users can apply the ideas in a repeatable way.
You will get a clear path from prerequisites to practical steps, with examples, safeguards, and next steps.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| Node.js | 22+ (check: node --version) |
| OS | macOS, Linux, Windows (via WSL2) |
| Memory | 2GB RAM minimum (4GB+ recommended for browser automation) |
| Storage | 500MB for installation |

If you are already running Moltbot, you can skip installation and focus on configuration and workflows.

## How to apply this topic

> ⚠️ Review install scripts before running them in production. Avoid committing API keys or secrets to version control.

1. Install and onboard if you are new to the platform.
```bash
curl -fsSL https://clawd.bot/install.sh | bash
clawdbot onboard
clawdbot health
```

2. Start the gateway and confirm it is reachable locally.
```bash
clawdbot gateway --port 18789 --verbose
```

3. Connect one messaging channel and run a small workflow end-to-end.
Keep the scope small, measure latency, and expand only after you confirm stable behavior.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|---|---|
| Command not found | Ensure Node.js 22+ is installed and your PATH is updated. |
| Gateway not reachable | Confirm the gateway is bound to loopback and port 18789 is free. |
| Auth errors | Verify API keys and rotate them if they may be exposed. |
| Slow responses | Reduce active skills, test a smaller model, and review logs. |
| Messages not delivered | Re-check channel tokens and allow-lists. |
