## Use Case Comparison

### Customer Support Bot

**Botpress (ideal choice):**
- Visual flow: Greeting → Problem type → Solution
- Intent training: "My order is late" → shipping_issue
- Handoff: Escalate to human agent
- Analytics: Track resolution rates

**Moltbot (not ideal):**
- Would work but lacks customer-facing features
- No built-in analytics or handoff
- Better for internal use

### Personal AI Assistant

**Moltbot (ideal choice):**
```
User: "Summarize my emails and add the meeting to calendar"
Moltbot: [Reads emails, summarizes, adds calendar event]
```
Personal productivity, messaging access.

**Botpress (not ideal):**
- Overkill for personal use
- Flow-based design doesn't fit open-ended requests
- No native Telegram/Discord

## When to Choose Each

**Choose Botpress if:**
- Building a customer support chatbot
- Non-technical team members need to contribute
- You need conversation analytics
- Intent-based flows match your use case
- Enterprise features (SSO, audit) are required

**Choose Moltbot if:**
- You want a personal AI assistant
- Messaging apps are your interface
- You prefer LLM reasoning over intent matching
- Developer comfort with CLI/config
- LLM flexibility matters

## Different Problems, Different Solutions

Botpress and Moltbot rarely compete directly:
- **Botpress** for external, customer-facing chatbots
- **Moltbot** for internal, personal AI assistants

Some organizations use both.

## Try Moltbot

```bash
curl -fsSL https://molt.bot/install.sh | bash
moltbot onboard
moltbot health
```

## Conclusion

Botpress is the right choice for building customer-facing chatbots with visual flows, intent training, and analytics. It's designed for business teams.

Moltbot is the right choice for personal AI assistants with full LLM reasoning, messaging integration, and developer-friendly setup. They serve different needs.
