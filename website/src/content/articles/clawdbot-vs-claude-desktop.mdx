# Claude Desktop vs Moltbot: 6 Key Differences

![Claude Desktop vs Moltbot comparison](/images/articles/clawdbot-vs-claude-desktop.jpg)

## TL;DR - Quick Decision Guide

| If you... | Choose |
|-----------|--------|
| Want a simple desktop chat app | Claude Desktop |
| Need multi-channel access (Telegram, Discord) | Moltbot |
| Want MCP (Model Context Protocol) support | Both work |
| Need 24/7 automation and agents | Moltbot |
| Prefer polished native UI | Claude Desktop |
| Want to switch between LLMs | Moltbot |

## Same Model, Different Interfaces

**Claude Desktop** is Anthropic's official desktop app. It provides a polished chat interface for Claude, supports MCP for local tool use, and works great for individual productivity.

**Moltbot** (61K+ GitHub stars) is a self-hosted gateway that also uses Claude (and other LLMs). But it focuses on messaging integration, automation, and always-on agents—not just desktop chat.

Both use Claude. The difference is *how* you interact with it.
