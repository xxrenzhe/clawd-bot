# Cursor vs Moltbot: Which AI Coder Wins?

![Cursor vs Moltbot comparison](/images/articles/clawdbot-vs-cursor.jpg)

## TL;DR - Quick Decision Guide

| If you... | Choose |
|-----------|--------|
| Want AI deeply integrated in your editor | Cursor |
| Prefer terminal/CLI-based coding | Moltbot |
| Need inline code completion | Cursor |
| Want AI via Telegram while away from desk | Moltbot |
| Work exclusively in VS Code-style editors | Cursor |
| Need automation beyond coding | Moltbot |

## Different Tools for Different Workflows

**Cursor** is an AI-native IDE (VS Code fork). It excels at inline completions, codebase chat, and editor-integrated AI features. You work inside the editor.

**Moltbot** is an AI gateway you can message from anywhere—terminal, Telegram, Discord. It can run code, create PRs, and automate tasks. You work from any interface.

They're complementary more than competitive.

## Feature Comparison

| Feature | Cursor | Moltbot |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Interface | IDE (VS Code fork) | Terminal, Telegram, Discord |
| Inline Completion | Yes (excellent) | No |
| Codebase Chat | Yes | Via GitHub skills |
| Price | $20/mo (Pro) | Free + API costs |
| Code Execution | Limited | Full (with sandboxing) |
| PR Creation | No | Yes (GitHub skill) |
| Works Offline | No | With local LLMs |
| Mobile Access | No | Yes (via messaging) |

## Cursor Strengths

- **Inline completions**: Tab-complete suggestions as you type
- **Codebase awareness**: Indexes your entire project for context
- **Edit mode**: Highlight code, describe changes, AI applies them
- **Composer**: Multi-file changes from natural language
- **Native feel**: Works like VS Code with AI superpowers

## Moltbot Strengths

- **Interface freedom**: Terminal, Telegram, Discord—code from anywhere
- **Full execution**: Run tests, deploy, manage infrastructure
- **Automation**: 565+ skills for GitHub, CI/CD, cloud providers
- **LLM choice**: Use Claude, GPT-4, or local models
- **Free core**: Pay only for API usage

## Workflow Comparison

### Task: "Add error handling to this function"

**Cursor:**
1. Open file in Cursor
2. Select function
3. Cmd+K, type "add error handling"
4. Review inline diff
5. Accept changes

**Moltbot:**
```bash
moltbot "Add error handling to the processOrder function in src/orders.ts"
# Or via Telegram:
# "Add error handling to processOrder in the orders file"
```

### Task: "Run tests and fix failures"

**Cursor:**
1. Manually run tests in terminal
2. Copy error output
3. Paste to Cursor chat
4. Apply suggested fixes

**Moltbot:**
```bash
moltbot "Run the test suite. If any tests fail, analyze and fix them."
# Moltbot runs tests, reads output, edits files, re-runs tests
```

### Task: "Create PR for these changes"

**Cursor:** Not supported—use GitHub CLI separately.

**Moltbot:**
```bash
moltbot "Commit these changes and create a PR with a good description"
# Creates branch, commits, pushes, opens PR
```

## When to Use Each

### Use Cursor for:
- Writing new code with inline completions
- Exploring unfamiliar codebases via chat
- Quick edits while you're in the editor
- When you want AI suggestions as you type

### Use Moltbot for:
- Running commands and automation
- Creating PRs and managing GitHub
- Coding from your phone via Telegram
- When you need AI to execute, not just suggest
- Integrating AI into existing terminal workflows

## Cost Comparison (Annual)

| Level | Cursor | Moltbot |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Free tier | Limited features | Full features |
| Regular use | $240/year | ~$60-180/year (API) |
| Heavy use | $240/year | ~$180-360/year (API) |

Cursor has flat pricing; Moltbot scales with usage.

## Use Both?

Many developers use both:
- **Cursor** when actively writing code in the editor
- **Moltbot** for automation, mobile access, and terminal workflows

They don't overlap much—Cursor is an IDE, Moltbot is an automation gateway.

## Try Moltbot

```bash
curl -fsSL https://molt.bot/install.sh | bash
moltbot onboard
moltbot health
```

## Conclusion

Cursor wins for in-editor AI coding—inline completions, codebase chat, and VS Code integration are excellent.

Moltbot wins for automation, execution, and flexibility—run tests, create PRs, code from Telegram, use any LLM. If you want AI that does more than suggest code, Moltbot is the answer.

For many developers, the right choice is both.
