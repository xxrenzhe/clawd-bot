# Dialogflow vs Moltbot: Google AI vs Self-Hosted

![Dialogflow vs Moltbot comparison](/images/articles/clawdbot-vs-dialogflow.jpg)

## TL;DR - Quick Decision Guide

| If you... | Choose |
|-----------|--------|
| Need to keep all data off Google's servers | Moltbot |
| Want intent-based chatbot with training | Dialogflow |
| Prefer LLM reasoning over predefined intents | Moltbot |
| Build for Google Assistant or Google Home | Dialogflow |
| Need Telegram, Discord, or WhatsApp integration | Moltbot |
| Want enterprise support from Google | Dialogflow |

## Overview

**Dialogflow** is Google's NLU platform for building conversational interfaces. It uses intent matching—you define phrases, train the model, and map responses. Great for structured interactions but requires upfront design work.

**Moltbot** (free, open-source) takes a different approach: connect LLMs like Claude directly to messaging apps. No intent training needed—the LLM handles natural conversation. You self-host and control your data.

| Price | Free (pay for LLM API) | Free tier, then $0.002/request |
| Data Privacy | Self-hosted, local data | Google Cloud |
| Setup Time | 3 commands | Hours of intent design |
| Flexibility | Any conversation | Predefined flows |
| Messaging | 10+ platforms native | Via integrations |
| Google Assistant | No | Native |
| Open Source | Yes | No |

## When to Choose Each

**Choose Moltbot if:**
- Privacy is critical��you can't send data to Google
- You want natural conversations without designing intents
- You need a personal AI assistant, not a customer service bot
- You prefer Claude or other LLMs over Google's NLU
- You value open-source and self-hosting

**Choose Dialogflow if:**
- You're building for Google Assistant or Google Home
- You need predictable, structured conversation flows
- Enterprise support and SLAs are required
- You're already in the Google Cloud ecosystem
- You need telephony/voice bot capabilities

## Cost Comparison (Monthly, 10K requests)

| Scenario | Moltbot | Dialogflow ES | Dialogflow CX |
|----------|---------|---------------|---------------|
| 10K requests | ~$10-30 (API) | Free tier | $20 |
| 100K requests | ~$100-300 | $140 | $200 |
| 1M requests | ~$1,000-3,000 | $1,400 | $2,000 |

*Moltbot costs vary by LLM and prompt length. Dialogflow CX is more expensive but more powerful.*

## Key Difference: Intent vs LLM

**Dialogflow approach:**
```
User: "Book a table for 2 at 7pm"
→ Intent: restaurant.booking
→ Entities: party_size=2, time=7pm
→ Response: "I've booked a table for 2 at 7pm"
```
You must define the intent and train examples.

**Moltbot approach:**
```
User: "Book a table for 2 at 7pm"
→ LLM understands context
→ Calls restaurant API skill
�� Response: "Done! Table for 2 at 7pm at La Maison"
```
No training—LLM + skills handle it.

## Try Moltbot

```bash
curl -fsSL https://molt.bot/install.sh | bash
moltbot onboard
moltbot health
```

## Conclusion

Dialogflow excels at structured, predictable chatbot flows—especially if you're building for Google Assistant or need enterprise features. But it requires significant upfront design and sends all data through Google's cloud.

Moltbot is the better choice for personal AI assistants, privacy-focused deployments, and scenarios where you want natural LLM conversations without training intents. It's free, open-source, and keeps your data local.
