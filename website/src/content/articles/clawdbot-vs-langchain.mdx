## Development Comparison

### Building a Research Assistant

**LangChain (days of work):**
```python
from langchain import ...

# Set up LLM
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4")

# Create tools
search_tool = TavilySearchTool()
browser_tool = BrowserTool()

# Build agent
agent = create_react_agent(llm, tools, prompt)

# Add memory
memory = ConversationBufferMemory()

# Create chain
chain = AgentExecutor(agent, tools, memory)

# Build interface
# Add Telegram integration...
# Handle errors...
# Add logging...
```

**Moltbot (5 minutes):**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://molt.bot/install.sh | bash
