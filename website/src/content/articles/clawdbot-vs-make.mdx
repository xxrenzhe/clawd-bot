# Make (Integromat) vs Moltbot: Which Automates Better?

![Make vs Moltbot comparison](/images/articles/clawdbot-vs-make.jpg)

## TL;DR - Quick Decision Guide

| If you... | Choose |
|-----------|--------|
| Want visual drag-and-drop workflows | Make |
| Want AI-native automation | Moltbot |
| Need 1,500+ app integrations | Make |
| Prefer messaging-based control | Moltbot |
| Build complex multi-branch scenarios | Make |
| Want unlimited operations for free | Moltbot |

## Visual Scenarios vs AI Commands

**Make** (formerly Integromat) is a visual automation platform with 1,500+ app integrations. More capable than Zapier with advanced branching.

**Moltbot** uses natural language: describe tasks and the LLM handles the logic. No visual builder needed.

## Feature Comparison

| Feature | Make | Moltbot |
|---------|------|---------|
| Workflow Style | Visual scenarios | AI + natural language |
| App Integrations | 1,500+ | 565+ skills |
| Free Tier | 1,000 ops/month | Unlimited |
| Pricing | $9-$299+/month | Free + LLM API |
| Self-Hosted | No | Yes |
| Mobile Control | Web only | Telegram, Discord |

## Make Strengths

- **Visual power**: See complex data flows as diagrams
- **1,500+ integrations**: Connect most SaaS tools
- **Advanced operations**: Iterators, aggregators, routers
- **Affordable plans**: Cheaper than Zapier at scale

## Moltbot Strengths

- **AI-native**: LLM adapts to context dynamically
- **No operation limits**: Pay only for LLM API
- **Messaging control**: Telegram, Discord access
- **Self-hosted**: Your data stays on your servers

## Cost Comparison

| Monthly Operations | Make | Moltbot |
|-------------------|------|---------|
| 10,000 ops | $9/mo | ~$15-40 (API) |
| 40,000 ops | $16/mo | ~$40-100 (API) |
| 150,000 ops | $29/mo | ~$100-250 (API) |

*Make is cheaper for high-volume, simple operations. Moltbot scales better for AI-intensive tasks.*

## When to Choose Each

**Choose Make if:**
- You need 1,500+ app integrations
- Complex data transformation is required
- You prefer visual workflow design

**Choose Moltbot if:**
- AI-driven logic is valuable
- You want messaging-based control
- Self-hosting is important

## Try Moltbot

```bash
curl -fsSL https://molt.bot/install.sh | bash
moltbot onboard
moltbot health
```

## Introduction

Make  vs Moltbot: Which Automates Better? matters because it shapes how teams design reliable AI workflows and measure outcomes.
This guide explains the essentials and shows how Moltbot users can apply the ideas in a repeatable way.
You will get a clear path from prerequisites to practical steps, with examples, safeguards, and next steps.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| Node.js | 22+ (check: node --version) |
| OS | macOS, Linux, Windows (via WSL2) |
| Memory | 2GB RAM minimum (4GB+ recommended for browser automation) |
| Storage | 500MB for installation |

If you are already running Moltbot, you can skip installation and focus on configuration and workflows.

## How to apply this topic

> ⚠️ Review install scripts before running them in production. Avoid committing API keys or secrets to version control.

1. Install and onboard if you are new to the platform.
```bash
curl -fsSL https://clawd.bot/install.sh | bash
clawdbot onboard
clawdbot health
```

2. Start the gateway and confirm it is reachable locally.
```bash
clawdbot gateway --port 18789 --verbose
```

3. Connect one messaging channel and run a small workflow end-to-end.
Keep the scope small, measure latency, and expand only after you confirm stable behavior.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|---|---|
| Command not found | Ensure Node.js 22+ is installed and your PATH is updated. |
| Gateway not reachable | Confirm the gateway is bound to loopback and port 18789 is free. |
| Auth errors | Verify API keys and rotate them if they may be exposed. |
| Slow responses | Reduce active skills, test a smaller model, and review logs. |
| Messages not delivered | Re-check channel tokens and allow-lists. |

## Additional Notes

Moltbot workflows work best when you keep inputs tight and outputs measurable.
Define success criteria for make  vs moltbot: which automates better? before you automate anything significant.

For teams, document configuration changes and run clawdbot doctor after major edits.
This keeps the gateway stable and reduces debugging time when scaling up.

Key reminders:
- Keep tokens and passwords out of version control.
- Validate the gateway locally before exposing it.
- Roll out new skills in small batches and monitor logs.
- Re-check allow-lists after any channel changes.
