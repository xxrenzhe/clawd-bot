## TL;DR - Quick Decision Guide

| If you... | Choose |
|-----------|--------|

## Overview

**Microsoft Copilot** ($30/user/month) is Microsoft's AI assistant embedded in Office 365 apps. It excels at Word document drafting, Excel data analysis, and PowerPoint generation—but only within the Microsoft ecosystem.

**Moltbot** (free, open-source) is a self-hosted AI gateway with 61,000+ GitHub stars. It connects any LLM (Claude, GPT-4, local models) to messaging platforms like Telegram and Discord. You own your data and pay only for API usage.

## When to Choose Each

**Choose Moltbot if:**
- You want a free, open-source solution
- You use Telegram, Discord, or WhatsApp for communication
- You prefer Claude or want to switch LLMs freely
- Data privacy and self-hosting are priorities
- You're comfortable with command-line setup

**Choose Microsoft Copilot if:**
- You already pay for Microsoft 365 Business/Enterprise
- You work primarily in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint
- You need enterprise compliance out of the box
- Your team lives in Microsoft Teams
- You want zero configuration

## Cost Comparison (Annual)

| Scenario | Moltbot | Microsoft Copilot |
|----------|---------|-------------------|
| Solo user | ~$60-240 (API costs) | $360 + M365 subscription |
| Team of 5 | ~$300-1,200 (API costs) | $1,800 + M365 subscriptions |
| Enterprise 50 | ~$3,000-12,000 | $18,000 + M365 E5 |

*Moltbot costs scale with actual usage. Light users pay less.*

## Try Moltbot in 3 Commands

```bash
curl -fsSL https://molt.bot/install.sh | bash
moltbot onboard
moltbot health
```

Or with Docker:
```bash
docker run -d -e ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key -p 18789:18789 moltbot/moltbot
```

## Conclusion

Microsoft Copilot wins if you're already in the Microsoft ecosystem and need native Office integration. Moltbot wins if you want freedom—free pricing, any LLM, any messaging platform, and full control over your data.

For most personal users and small teams, Moltbot's open-source approach offers better value. Enterprise users with Microsoft 365 E5 may find Copilot's seamless integration worth the cost.
