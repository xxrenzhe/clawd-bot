# n8n vs Moltbot: Open Source Automation Showdown

![n8n vs Moltbot comparison](/images/articles/clawdbot-vs-n8n.jpg)

## TL;DR - Quick Decision Guide

| If you... | Choose |
|-----------|--------|
| Want visual workflow builder | n8n |
| Want AI-native automation | Moltbot |
| Need 400+ app integrations | n8n |
| Prefer messaging-based control | Moltbot |
| Build complex multi-step workflows | n8n |
| Want LLM to make decisions | Moltbot |

Both are open-source and self-hosted. They serve different automation styles.

## Two Flavors of Self-Hosted Automation

**n8n** is a visual workflow automation platform (like Zapier, but self-hosted). You connect nodes in a flowchart: triggers, actions, conditionals. Great for complex, deterministic workflows.

**Moltbot** is an AI-native automation gateway. You describe tasks in natural language, and an LLM (Claude, GPT-4) figures out how to execute them. Great for flexible, conversational automation.

## Feature Comparison

| Feature | n8n | Moltbot |
|---------|-----|---------|
| Workflow Style | Visual flowchart | AI + natural language |
| Integrations | 400+ nodes | 565+ skills |
| LLM Support | Via AI nodes | Native (core feature) |
| Interface | Web-based editor | Terminal, Telegram, Discord |
| Self-Hosted | Yes (Docker) | Yes (Docker/native) |
| Open Source | Yes (fair-code) | Yes (MIT) |
| Free | Yes (self-hosted) | Yes + LLM API costs |
| Mobile Access | Web UI | Native messaging apps |

## n8n Strengths

- **Visual editor**: See your entire workflow as a flowchart
- **400+ integrations**: Connect databases, APIs, SaaS tools
- **Complex logic**: Loops, conditionals, error handling built-in
- **Debugging**: Step through workflows, inspect data at each stage
- **Community**: Large template library, active forums

## Moltbot Strengths

- **AI-native**: Describe tasks, let LLM figure out steps
- **Conversational**: "Do X" via Telegram, get results back
- **Dynamic decisions**: AI handles edge cases without predefined rules
- **Messaging-first**: Control from Telegram, Discord, WhatsApp
- **No visual builder required**: Natural language replaces flowcharts

## Workflow Comparison

### Scenario: "When file uploaded, process and notify"

**n8n:**
```
[Webhook Trigger] → [Parse File] → [Transform Data] → [Send Slack Message]
                         ↓
                  [Error Handler] → [Log to Database]
```
Visual, explicit, predictable.

**Moltbot:**
```
"When a file hits the uploads folder, analyze it and
 send me a summary on Telegram. If it fails, let me know."
```
AI infers the steps.

### Scenario: "Different handling based on file type"

**n8n:**
```
[File Trigger] → [Switch Node]
                    ├── PDF → [Extract Text] → [Summarize]
                    ├── CSV → [Parse] → [Analyze]
                    └── Image → [OCR] → [Extract Data]
```
You build each branch explicitly.

**Moltbot:**
```
"Process uploaded files appropriately based on their type."
```
AI adapts to each file type dynamically.

## Architecture Comparison

**n8n deployment:**
```bash
docker run -d --name n8n \
  -p 5678:5678 \
  -v ~/.n8n:/home/node/.n8n \
  n8nio/n8n
```
Access at http://localhost:5678, build workflows in browser.

**Moltbot deployment:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://molt.bot/install.sh | bash
moltbot onboard
moltbot health
```
Control via terminal or Telegram.

## Cost Comparison

| Component | n8n | Moltbot |
|-----------|-----|---------|
| Platform | Free (self-hosted) | Free |
| Cloud option | €20+/month | N/A |
| LLM costs | Per AI node use | ~$5-50/month |
| Hosting | VPS ~$5-20/month | VPS ~$5-20/month |

Both are free to self-host. Moltbot has LLM API costs; n8n has optional cloud plans.

## When to Choose Each

**Choose n8n if:**
- You want visual workflow design
- You need 400+ app integrations
- Workflows are complex but deterministic
- You prefer seeing the entire flow as a diagram
- Debugging step-by-step is important

**Choose Moltbot if:**
- AI-driven automation is your goal
- Messaging control (Telegram, Discord) is preferred
- Workflows need to adapt dynamically
- Natural language is easier than flowcharts
- You want a personal AI assistant, not just automation

## Use Both?

They work together well:
- **n8n** for complex, deterministic backend workflows
- **Moltbot** for conversational AI interface and dynamic tasks

n8n can call Moltbot via webhook; Moltbot can trigger n8n workflows.

## Try Moltbot

```bash
curl -fsSL https://molt.bot/install.sh | bash
moltbot onboard
moltbot health
```

## Conclusion

n8n wins for visual workflow building with 400+ integrations and complex logic. If you think in flowcharts and need predictable automation, n8n is excellent.

Moltbot wins for AI-native, conversational automation. If you want to tell an assistant what to do rather than draw it out, and you value messaging access, Moltbot is the better fit.

For many users, the combination is powerful: n8n for structured backend, Moltbot for AI interface.
