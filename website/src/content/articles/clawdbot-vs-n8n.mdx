# n8n vs Moltbot: Open Source Automation Showdown

![n8n vs Moltbot comparison](/images/articles/clawdbot-vs-n8n.jpg)

## TL;DR - Quick Decision Guide

| If you... | Choose |
|-----------|--------|
| Want visual workflow builder | n8n |
| Want AI-native automation | Moltbot |
| Need 400+ app integrations | n8n |
| Prefer messaging-based control | Moltbot |
| Build complex multi-step workflows | n8n |
| Want LLM to make decisions | Moltbot |

Both are open-source and self-hosted. They serve different automation styles.

## Two Flavors of Self-Hosted Automation

**n8n** is a visual workflow automation platform (like Zapier, but self-hosted). You connect nodes in a flowchart: triggers, actions, conditionals. Great for complex, deterministic workflows.

**Moltbot** is an AI-native automation gateway. You describe tasks in natural language, and an LLM (Claude, GPT-4) figures out how to execute them. Great for flexible, conversational automation.

## Feature Comparison

| Feature | n8n | Moltbot |
|---------|-----|---------|
| Workflow Style | Visual flowchart | AI + natural language |
| Integrations | 400+ nodes | 565+ skills |
| LLM Support | Via AI nodes | Native (core feature) |
| Interface | Web-based editor | Terminal, Telegram, Discord |
| Self-Hosted | Yes (Docker) | Yes (Docker/native) |
| Open Source | Yes (fair-code) | Yes (MIT) |
| Free | Yes (self-hosted) | Yes + LLM API costs |
| Mobile Access | Web UI | Native messaging apps |

## n8n Strengths

- **Visual editor**: See your entire workflow as a flowchart
- **400+ integrations**: Connect databases, APIs, SaaS tools
- **Complex logic**: Loops, conditionals, error handling built-in
- **Debugging**: Step through workflows, inspect data at each stage
- **Community**: Large template library, active forums

## Moltbot Strengths

- **AI-native**: Describe tasks, let LLM figure out steps
- **Conversational**: "Do X" via Telegram, get results back
- **Dynamic decisions**: AI handles edge cases without predefined rules
- **Messaging-first**: Control from Telegram, Discord, WhatsApp
- **No visual builder required**: Natural language replaces flowcharts

## Workflow Comparison

### Scenario: "When file uploaded, process and notify"

**n8n:**
```
[Webhook Trigger] → [Parse File] → [Transform Data] → [Send Slack Message]
                         ↓
                  [Error Handler] → [Log to Database]
```
Visual, explicit, predictable.

**Moltbot:**
```
"When a file hits the uploads folder, analyze it and
 send me a summary on Telegram. If it fails, let me know."
```
AI infers the steps.

### Scenario: "Different handling based on file type"

**n8n:**
```
[File Trigger] → [Switch Node]
                    ├── PDF → [Extract Text] → [Summarize]
                    ├── CSV → [Parse] → [Analyze]
                    └── Image → [OCR] → [Extract Data]
```
You build each branch explicitly.

**Moltbot:**
```
"Process uploaded files appropriately based on their type."
```
AI adapts to each file type dynamically.

## Architecture Comparison

**n8n deployment:**
```bash
docker run -d --name n8n \
  -p 5678:5678 \
  -v ~/.n8n:/home/node/.n8n \
  n8nio/n8n
```
Access at http://localhost:5678, build workflows in browser.

**Moltbot deployment:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://molt.bot/install.sh | bash
moltbot onboard
moltbot health
```
Control via terminal or Telegram.

## Cost Comparison

| Component | n8n | Moltbot |
|-----------|-----|---------|
| Platform | Free (self-hosted) | Free |
| Cloud option | €20+/month | N/A |
| LLM costs | Per AI node use | ~$5-50/month |
| Hosting | VPS ~$5-20/month | VPS ~$5-20/month |

Both are free to self-host. Moltbot has LLM API costs; n8n has optional cloud plans.

## When to Choose Each

**Choose n8n if:**
- You want visual workflow design
- You need 400+ app integrations
- Workflows are complex but deterministic
- You prefer seeing the entire flow as a diagram
- Debugging step-by-step is important

**Choose Moltbot if:**
- AI-driven automation is your goal
- Messaging control (Telegram, Discord) is preferred
- Workflows need to adapt dynamically
- Natural language is easier than flowcharts
- You want a personal AI assistant, not just automation

## Use Both?

They work together well:
- **n8n** for complex, deterministic backend workflows
- **Moltbot** for conversational AI interface and dynamic tasks

n8n can call Moltbot via webhook; Moltbot can trigger n8n workflows.

## Try Moltbot

```bash
curl -fsSL https://molt.bot/install.sh | bash
moltbot onboard
moltbot health
```

## Introduction

n8n vs Moltbot: Open Source Automation Showdown matters because it shapes how teams design reliable AI workflows and measure outcomes.
This guide explains the essentials and shows how Moltbot users can apply the ideas in a repeatable way.
You will get a clear path from prerequisites to practical steps, with examples, safeguards, and next steps.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| Node.js | 22+ (check: node --version) |
| OS | macOS, Linux, Windows (via WSL2) |
| Memory | 2GB RAM minimum (4GB+ recommended for browser automation) |
| Storage | 500MB for installation |

If you are already running Moltbot, you can skip installation and focus on configuration and workflows.

## How to apply this topic

> ⚠️ Review install scripts before running them in production. Avoid committing API keys or secrets to version control.

1. Install and onboard if you are new to the platform.
```bash
curl -fsSL https://clawd.bot/install.sh | bash
clawdbot onboard
clawdbot health
```

2. Start the gateway and confirm it is reachable locally.
```bash
clawdbot gateway --port 18789 --verbose
```

3. Connect one messaging channel and run a small workflow end-to-end.
Keep the scope small, measure latency, and expand only after you confirm stable behavior.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|---|---|
| Command not found | Ensure Node.js 22+ is installed and your PATH is updated. |
| Gateway not reachable | Confirm the gateway is bound to loopback and port 18789 is free. |
| Auth errors | Verify API keys and rotate them if they may be exposed. |
| Slow responses | Reduce active skills, test a smaller model, and review logs. |
| Messages not delivered | Re-check channel tokens and allow-lists. |

## Conclusion

n8n wins for visual workflow building with 400+ integrations and complex logic. If you think in flowcharts and need predictable automation, n8n is excellent.

Moltbot wins for AI-native, conversational automation. If you want to tell an assistant what to do rather than draw it out, and you value messaging access, Moltbot is the better fit.

For many users, the combination is powerful: n8n for structured backend, Moltbot for AI interface.

## Additional Notes

Moltbot workflows work best when you keep inputs tight and outputs measurable.
Define success criteria for n8n vs moltbot: open source automation showdown before you automate anything significant.

For teams, document configuration changes and run clawdbot doctor after major edits.
This keeps the gateway stable and reduces debugging time when scaling up.

Key reminders:
- Keep tokens and passwords out of version control.
- Validate the gateway locally before exposing it.
- Roll out new skills in small batches and monitor logs.
- Re-check allow-lists after any channel changes.
