# Moltbot Workflow Optimization: Boost Productivity

![Moltbot Workflow Optimization](/images/articles/clawdbot-workflow-optimization.jpg)

## Workflow Patterns

| Pattern | Use Case | Complexity |
|---------|----------|------------|
| Trigger-Action | Event responses | Low |
| Chain | Multi-step processes | Medium |
| Parallel | Independent tasks | Medium |
| Conditional | Decision flows | High |

<HostingCTA context="setup" />

## Trigger-Action Workflows

### Basic Pattern

```json
{
  "workflows": {
    "email-alert": {
      "trigger": {
        "type": "event",
        "source": "gmail",
        "filter": { "from": "important@client.com" }
      },
      "action": {
        "type": "notify",
        "channel": "telegram",
        "message": "Important email from {{from}}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Common Triggers

| Trigger | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Schedule | `cron:0 9 * * *` |
| Event | `gmail:new_email` |
| Keyword | `message:contains:urgent` |
| Webhook | `webhook:github:push` |

<HostingCTA context="inline" />

## Chain Workflows

### Sequential Steps

```json
{
  "workflows": {
    "meeting-prep": {
      "trigger": "cron:0 8 * * 1-5",
      "steps": [
        {
          "id": "get-meetings",
          "tool": "calendar_today"
        },
        {
          "id": "fetch-docs",
          "tool": "drive_search",
          "input": "{{get-meetings.attendees}}"
        },
        {
          "id": "summarize",
          "tool": "agent_chat",
          "input": "Summarize: {{fetch-docs.content}}"
        },
        {
          "id": "notify",
          "tool": "telegram_send",
          "input": "{{summarize.response}}"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### With Error Handling

```json
{
  "workflows": {
    "data-sync": {
      "steps": [
        {
          "id": "fetch",
          "tool": "api_fetch",
          "onError": "skip"
        },
        {
          "id": "process",
          "tool": "transform",
          "onError": {
            "action": "notify",
            "message": "Sync failed: {{error}}"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Parallel Workflows

### Concurrent Execution

```json
{
  "workflows": {
    "morning-briefing": {
      "trigger": "cron:0 7 * * *",
      "parallel": [
        { "tool": "weather_get", "as": "weather" },
        { "tool": "calendar_today", "as": "calendar" },
        { "tool": "email_unread", "as": "emails" },
        { "tool": "news_fetch", "as": "news" }
      ],
      "then": {
        "tool": "agent_chat",
        "prompt": "Create briefing from: {{weather}}, {{calendar}}, {{emails}}, {{news}}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Conditional Workflows

### Decision Flow

```json
{
  "workflows": {
    "ticket-triage": {
      "trigger": "zendesk:new_ticket",
      "steps": [
        {
          "id": "classify",
          "tool": "agent_classify",
          "input": "{{ticket.body}}"
        },
        {
          "id": "route",
          "type": "switch",
          "on": "{{classify.category}}",
          "cases": {
            "billing": { "action": "assign", "to": "billing-team" },
            "technical": { "action": "assign", "to": "support-team" },
            "sales": { "action": "assign", "to": "sales-team" },
            "default": { "action": "queue", "to": "general" }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Optimization Tips

### Reduce Latency

| Technique | Benefit |
|-----------|---------|
| Cache frequent queries | 50-90% faster |
| Use parallel execution | 2-3x speedup |
| Pre-fetch predictable data | Instant responses |

### Cache Configuration

```json
{
  "workflows": {
    "market-check": {
      "cache": {
        "enabled": true,
        "ttl": 300,
        "key": "market-data"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Rate Limiting

```json
{
  "workflows": {
    "api-sync": {
      "rateLimit": {
        "requests": 100,
        "window": "1m"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Monitoring Workflows

### View Status

```bash
moltbot workflows status
```

Output:
```
📊 Workflow Status

Active: 5
├─ morning-briefing: Running (7:00 daily)
├─ email-alert: Listening
├─ meeting-prep: Running (8:00 daily)
├─ ticket-triage: Listening
└─ market-check: Running (every 5m)

Last 24h:
├─ Executions: 156
├─ Success: 152 (97%)
└─ Avg duration: 2.3s
```

### Debug Mode

```bash
moltbot workflows run morning-briefing --debug
```

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Workflow not triggering | Wrong cron syntax | Validate schedule |
| Step timeout | Slow API | Increase timeout |
| Data not passed | Wrong reference | Check variable names |
| Partial execution | Error in chain | Add error handling |

## Introduction

Moltbot Workflow Optimization: Boost Productivity matters because it shapes how teams design reliable AI workflows and measure outcomes.
This guide explains the essentials and shows how Moltbot users can apply the ideas in a repeatable way.
You will get a clear path from prerequisites to practical steps, with examples, safeguards, and next steps.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| Node.js | 22+ (check: node --version) |
| OS | macOS, Linux, Windows (via WSL2) |
| Memory | 2GB RAM minimum (4GB+ recommended for browser automation) |
| Storage | 500MB for installation |

If you are already running Moltbot, you can skip installation and focus on configuration and workflows.

## How to apply this topic

> ⚠️ Review install scripts before running them in production. Avoid committing API keys or secrets to version control.

1. Install and onboard if you are new to the platform.
```bash
curl -fsSL https://clawd.bot/install.sh | bash
clawdbot onboard
clawdbot health
```

2. Start the gateway and confirm it is reachable locally.
```bash
clawdbot gateway --port 18789 --verbose
```

3. Connect one messaging channel and run a small workflow end-to-end.
Keep the scope small, measure latency, and expand only after you confirm stable behavior.

## Additional Notes

Moltbot workflows work best when you keep inputs tight and outputs measurable.
Define success criteria for moltbot workflow optimization: boost productivity before you automate anything significant.

For teams, document configuration changes and run clawdbot doctor after major edits.
This keeps the gateway stable and reduces debugging time when scaling up.

Key reminders:
- Keep tokens and passwords out of version control.
- Validate the gateway locally before exposing it.
- Roll out new skills in small batches and monitor logs.
- Re-check allow-lists after any channel changes.
