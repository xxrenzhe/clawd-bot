**My Plan for Crafting a Comprehensive LLM Comparison for Moltbot**

Okay, here's the game plan. As a technical writer, my mission is clear: produce a 1500-2500 word, professional yet approachable guide comparing LLM providers for Moltbot, also known as Clawdbot and Openclaw. This has to be a deep dive for the expert audience, so I'm aiming for maximum detail and clarity.

First, SEO is key. I'll naturally weave relevant keywords – "LLM providers," "Claude vs GPT," "Moltbot providers," "AI models comparison," and of course, "Openclaw," "Moltbot," and "Clawdbot" – into the headings and throughout the text.

The core structure is solidified: I'm starting with a killer hook about the evolution of AI gateways, introducing Moltbot (Clawdbot/Openclaw) as the focus. I'll clearly explain why choosing the right LLM is crucial – Moltbot is the body, the LLM is the brain. I'll immediately highlight Moltbot's architecture as an AI gateway.

I'll then dissect the major contenders: Claude (Anthropic), GPT-4 (OpenAI), and local LLMs (Ollama, Llama 3, Mistral) – the privacy-focused option – along with any others that warrant mention (e.g., Gemini). The comparison will be metric-driven: performance, cost, latency, and especially, the crucial tool-calling capabilities that directly impact Moltbot's "Skills" and "Plugins."

A crucial section will be a practical configuration guide, complete with code examples, detailing how to set up these providers within Moltbot. Security and privacy are paramount, especially for self-hosted solutions. I'll make sure to explicitly highlight things like `gateway.bind` to loopback, pairing mode, and secure password settings. I'll also create a clear recommendation matrix to help users choose the best LLM based on their specific use case.

The title will be "Comparing LLM Providers for Moltbot: Claude, GPT-4, and More," and the description will be equally clear and concise. The structure will be broken down into:

*   **The Foundation: Why LLM Selection Matters for Moltbot:** Explain Moltbot's role as a gateway and its reliance on Function Calling/Tool Use.
*   **Claude (Anthropic): The Native Experience:** Detail Claude 3.5 Sonnet / Opus, its strengths (reasoning, coding, long context), and integration with Clawdbot.
*   **GPT-4 (OpenAI): The Versatile Powerhouse:** Focus on GPT-4o, GPT-4 Turbo, strengths (speed, reliability, widespread tool support).
*   **Going Local with Ollama: Privacy and Performance:** Emphasize running Llama 3 or Mistral, benefits of Openclaw's self-hosting, and the `clawdbot health` command.
*   **Deep Dive Comparison (The Data):** Create a Markdown table comparing Cost vs. Intelligence vs. Latency.
*   **Practical Configuration:** Show how to switch providers using `config.yaml` or environment variables, and crucial install commands like `curl -fsSL https://clawd.bot/install.sh | bash` and `clawdbot onboard`.
*   **Security Best Practices:** Cover topics like `gateway.bind`, "pairing" mode, `gateway.auth.password`, and `gateway.trustedProxies`.
*   **Optimization Tips:** Offer advice on context window management and Skill selection.

I'll include mandatory CTAs (like `<HostingCTA context="setup" />` and `<HostingCTA context="conclusion" />`) and frontmatter. I'll double-check all verified product information, including install commands, security settings, and specific features. I'm aiming for a word count in the 2000 range to ensure the level of detail is high. The tone will be professional, but I'll avoid being overly dry; I want this to be a genuinely useful guide.

During the drafting process, I need to make sure I don't use too much filler. Focus on technical architecture, configuration parameters, and specific security instructions provided (loopback, pairing mode)

I have to make sure to explain *why* Claude is often favored for coding-heavy Moltbot tasks versus GPT-4's general-purpose reliability. And finally, I must emphasize that Openclaw's greatest strength is the ability to swap the "brain" (LLM) without changing the "body" (Moltbot).

Let's get this done!
