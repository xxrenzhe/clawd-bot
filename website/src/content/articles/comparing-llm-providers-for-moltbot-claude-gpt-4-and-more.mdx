# Comparing LLM Providers for Moltbot: Claude, GPT-4, and More

![Comparing LLM Providers for Moltbot](/images/articles/comparing-llm-providers-for-moltbot-claude-gpt-4-and-more.jpg)

## Introduction

Moltbot (also known as Clawdbot or Openclaw) is the gateway; the LLM is the brain. Choosing the right provider determines cost, quality, and operational stability. This guide helps you evaluate providers and build a model strategy that fits your workflows.

The goal is not to pick a single "best" model. It is to create a repeatable decision process so you can adjust as your requirements change.

## Evaluation criteria that matter in production

Use these criteria to compare providers:

- **Quality**: reasoning accuracy and instruction following
- **Latency**: response time and tail latency for long prompts
- **Cost**: pricing per token or per request
- **Tool support**: function calling, structured output, and retries
- **Data policy**: retention rules and compliance alignment

Measure these against the workflows you actually care about. A model that excels at creative text might underperform in strict JSON output or tool-heavy automation.

## Provider categories

Most teams evaluate providers in three buckets:

1. **Hosted frontier models** for top quality and low setup overhead.
2. **Specialized hosted models** for focused tasks or strong tool support.
3. **Local models** for privacy, cost control, and custom tuning.

Moltbot supports all three. This lets you route different tasks to different providers without rewriting your gateway.

## Build a simple evaluation harness

Before you decide, build a small evaluation set:

- 10-20 real prompts from your workflows
- Expected outputs or success criteria
- A scoring rubric for accuracy and format

Run the same set across providers and track accuracy, average latency, and error rates. This removes guesswork and surfaces trade-offs early.

## Tool calling and structured output

If your workflows rely on tools, evaluate how well each provider handles:

- Function calling reliability
- JSON or schema-constrained output
- Error recovery and retries

Even small differences here can change automation quality more than raw reasoning ability.

## Data residency and compliance

For regulated workloads, model choice must align with your data policy:

- Where is data processed?
- How long are logs retained?
- Can you opt out of data use?

When in doubt, use local models for sensitive workflows and reserve hosted models for non-sensitive tasks.

## Migration strategy

Your first model choice should not lock you in. Use routing so you can test alternatives without changing workflows. Keep prompts and retrieval in the gateway so switching models is a configuration change, not a code rewrite.

## Routing examples

Here is a simple routing approach:

- **Complex reasoning**: route to a top-tier hosted model
- **Structured summaries**: route to a mid-tier hosted model
- **Batch classification**: route to a local model

Routing makes cost predictable and keeps quality high where it matters.

## Latency budgeting

Latency is a product feature. Define budgets for:

- Interactive chats (fast responses)
- Background jobs (slower but cheaper)
- Batch processing (optimized for throughput)

Once budgets are defined, choose models and routing that meet them.

## Provider onboarding checklist

Before you adopt a provider, verify:

- API keys are scoped and rotated
- Rate limits are documented and tested
- Tool calling works with your schemas
- Logs and retries are visible in the gateway

A checklist prevents surprises after launch.

## Provider FAQ

**Should I pick one provider and stick with it?**  
No. Use routing so you can evolve as requirements change.

**Is it worth switching models for small gains?**  
Only if the gain is measurable on your evaluation set.

## Quick decision checklist

- Does the provider meet your latency budget?
- Does tool calling work with your schemas?
- Is the data policy acceptable for your workload?

If any answer is no, treat the provider as experimental.

## A practical comparison matrix

Here is a simple decision matrix you can adapt:

| Use case | Recommended approach |
|---|---|
| High-accuracy reasoning | Hosted frontier model |
| Structured tool calls | Provider with strong function calling |
| Cost-sensitive batch work | Local model or smaller hosted model |
| Sensitive data | Local or private deployment |

The best strategy is often hybrid: use premium models for complex tasks and smaller models for routine automation.

## Configuring providers in Moltbot

Start with a clean install:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://clawd.bot/install.sh | bash
clawdbot onboard
clawdbot health
```

Then define provider routing in your gateway configuration:

```yaml
models:
  default: "hosted-primary"
  routes:
    - name: "quick_tasks"
      provider: "local-small"
    - name: "deep_reasoning"
      provider: "hosted-primary"
```

This approach keeps your workflow code stable while you experiment with different model backends.

## When to go local

Local models are useful when you need privacy, predictable cost, or custom fine-tuning. They are also good for batch workloads where latency is less critical. For setup details, see [running local LLMs with Moltbot](/articles/running-local-llms-with-moltbot-ollama-and-open-source-model).

## Security and governance

Model choice affects security. Use these defaults:

- Bind the gateway to loopback or a private network.
- Keep API keys in environment variables.
- Rotate keys regularly and limit access.

See [Clawdbot security best practices](/articles/clawdbot-security-best-practices) and [environment variables](/articles/clawdbot-environment-variables).

## Cost and ROI considerations

LLM costs usually scale with token usage, retrieval size, and retries. You can reduce costs by:

- Tightening prompts and removing redundant context
- Using retrieval instead of large prompt windows
- Routing simple tasks to smaller models

## Conclusion

Choosing an LLM provider is not a one-time decision. With Moltbot, you can separate the gateway from the model and evolve your strategy over time. Start with a small evaluation set, measure real outcomes, and route tasks to the model that fits the job.
