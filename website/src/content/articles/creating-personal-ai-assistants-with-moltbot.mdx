**Crafting a Moltbot MDX Article: My Thinking Process**

Okay, so I'm diving into this Moltbot article. I need to make this a solid piece, and I'm treating this like a project. I'm going for an intermediate-level MDX article between 1500 and 2500 words. My goal is to produce a really solid piece of technical writing.

First, the frontmatter. That's essential. I need to get the dates, description, tags, and especially those keywords nailed down: "personal assistant," "ai assistant," "moltbot assistant," "custom assistant," "openclaw," "moltbot," and "clawdbot." Gotta make sure those are all in there, and I need to use them interchangeably to build SEO.

The structure is solid:

*   **Introduction:** I'll hook the reader by contrasting the limitations of standard, "walled garden" AI with the power of a self-hosted agent. I'll define Moltbot (and make sure to hit all the names, Openclaw, Clawdbot).
*   **Core Architecture:** I need to explain the Gateway concept, this is key.
*   **Installation Guide:** Straightforward, step-by-step with verified commands like `curl -fsSL https://clawd.bot/install.sh | bash` and `clawdbot onboard`.
*   **Configuration:** How to get it running and connecting to different LLMs – Claude, GPT-4, and Ollama.
*   **Platform Integration:** Telegram, Discord, Slack, etc. I'll need to clearly show how easy this is.
*   **Advanced Features:** Memory persistence, tools, skills, and, importantly, *computer access*. I need to highlight this.
*   **Security & Best Practices:** This has to be a critical section. Based on verified information, I'll emphasize loopback and pairing.
*   **Conclusion:** Summary and encouragement for adoption.

Now, let's break down the main content:

*   **Introduction:** Starting with the move from chatbots to *proactive* assistants. Openclaw/Moltbot/Clawdbot is the answer.
*   **CTA 1:** I need to get that `<HostingCTA context="setup" />` component in here.
*   **Main Body Sections:**
    *   What is Moltbot? (Clawdbot origin).
    *   Prerequisites – Linux/Unix, Node, and those API keys.
    *   Installation steps (again, using that `curl` command)
    *   Onboarding and Health Checks.
    *   Connecting Messaging Platforms (Telegram will be the primary example).
    *   **CTA 2:** `<HostingCTA context="inline" />`.
    *   Security Configuration (loopback, pairing, auth).
    *   Building Custom Skills/Memory.
*   **Free Install Service:** "We offer a free Moltbot installation service at \[Contact]/contact." This is important!
*   **Conclusion:** Recap everything.
*   **CTA 3:** `<HostingCTA context="conclusion" />`.

I’ll need to make sure I’m hitting the right word count. I'm aiming for around 1800.

I need to nail the technical accuracy. That means all the commands, like port 18789, need to be correct. I'll be sure to use headers, lists, and code blocks for proper MDX formatting.

Okay, let's do a quick critique: I need to really emphasize that "Computer Access" section. That's a key feature. I'll need to create a section specifically for "Proactive Automation and Computer Control." Also, I have to ensure the security section covers `gateway.bind` and `gateway.auth.password`. I will have a dedicated section on "Hardening Your Moltbot Deployment."

Alright, time to execute!
