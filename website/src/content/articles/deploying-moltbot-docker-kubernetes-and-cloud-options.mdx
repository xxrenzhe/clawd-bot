# Deploying Moltbot: Docker, Kubernetes, and Cloud Options

![Deploying Moltbot with Docker, Kubernetes, and cloud options](/images/articles/deploying-moltbot-docker-kubernetes-and-cloud-options.jpg)

## Introduction

Moltbot (Clawdbot/OpenClaw) is designed to be self-hosted, which means you can deploy it wherever your infrastructure lives. Some teams want a single VPS for predictable cost. Others need Kubernetes for scaling and isolation. This guide walks through the trade-offs and shows a practical path for each deployment style.

If you are new to self-hosting, start with a simple VPS. You can always migrate to containers or Kubernetes once your workflows stabilize.

## Deployment options at a glance

| Option | Best for | Pros | Cons |
|---|---|---|---|
| Docker on a VPS | Most teams starting out | Simple, fast setup | Less automated scaling |
| Kubernetes | Larger teams | Isolation, scaling, rollouts | Operational overhead |
| Managed cloud VM | Predictable workloads | Familiar ops model | Cost can grow quickly |

## Quick start (verified commands)

Even if you plan to use containers, start with a known-good install to validate the workflow:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://clawd.bot/install.sh | bash
clawdbot onboard
clawdbot health
clawdbot gateway --port 18789 --verbose
```

Once the gateway works, you can migrate to Docker or Kubernetes with confidence.

## Docker deployment (practical path)

Docker is the easiest way to package Moltbot with predictable dependencies. A typical setup includes:

- A persistent volume for Moltbot data
- Environment variables for API keys
- A reverse proxy (optional) for TLS

If you want a step-by-step guide, see [Docker setup](/articles/clawdbot-docker-setup). For TLS, combine it with [SSL setup](/articles/clawdbot-ssl-setup).

## Kubernetes deployment (team scale)

Kubernetes makes sense when you need standardized deployments, rollbacks, and resource isolation. Common patterns include:

- A Deployment for the gateway
- A Service for internal access
- A persistent volume claim for Moltbot data
- A separate Ingress or API gateway

Start with a minimal manifest and scale only after the workflow is stable. Use [Kubernetes guidance](/articles/clawdbot-kubernetes) as a baseline.

## Cloud VPS deployment (most common)

A single VPS is often enough for personal automation and small teams. The focus should be:

- Right-sizing CPU and memory
- Limiting public exposure
- Monitoring basic health metrics

A minimal VPS plan can support several workflows if you keep requests small and use local models only when needed. See [VPS deployment](/articles/clawdbot-vps-deployment) for a more detailed walkthrough.

## Sizing and cost planning

Capacity planning keeps performance stable and prevents surprise costs. For most small teams, a modest VPS with steady CPU and memory is enough. If you expect spikes, pick a plan that can scale up without re-provisioning the entire stack.

Simple planning tips:

- Start with a smaller instance and measure load for a week.
- Increase memory before CPU if you rely on long context.
- Use local models only when the hardware can handle it.

## Backup strategy

Backups are the cheapest form of reliability. At a minimum, back up configuration files and any persistent memory storage. If you use Docker or Kubernetes, ensure the volume data is included in the backup schedule.

If you are new to backups, add a weekly snapshot and verify it once. This small step prevents major recovery pain later. A simple monthly restore test builds confidence.

## Security checklist

No matter where you deploy, apply these safeguards:

- Bind the gateway to loopback or a private interface.
- Use pairing for messaging integrations.
- Store API keys in secrets, not plain text.
- Put reverse proxies behind authentication.

For more details, read [security best practices](/articles/clawdbot-security-best-practices).

## Monitoring and maintenance

A lightweight monitoring setup is enough for most deployments:

- A health check on the gateway port
- Disk usage alerts for the data volume
- Regular backups of configuration files

See [monitoring setup](/articles/clawdbot-monitoring-setup) and [maintenance](/articles/clawdbot-maintenance) for a practical checklist.

## Deployment FAQ

**Do I need Kubernetes to start?**  
No. Most teams are fine with a single VPS or a Docker host at first. Kubernetes only makes sense when you have multiple environments, strict isolation needs, or a large team that requires automated rollouts.

**Can I migrate later?**  
Yes. Start with a simple deployment and move to Kubernetes once your workflows are stable. Keep your configuration and data volumes well organized to make migration easy.
Document your deployment choices so migrations are painless.

## Free installation service

We offer a free Moltbot installation service. Our team can help you choose the right deployment path and configure your environment. [Contact us](/contact) to get started.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| Node.js | 22+ (check: node --version) |
| OS | macOS, Linux, Windows (via WSL2) |
| Memory | 2GB RAM minimum (4GB+ recommended for browser automation) |
| Storage | 500MB for installation |

If you are already running Moltbot, you can skip installation and focus on configuration and workflows.

## How to apply this topic

> ⚠️ Review install scripts before running them in production. Avoid committing API keys or secrets to version control.

1. Install and onboard if you are new to the platform.
```bash
curl -fsSL https://clawd.bot/install.sh | bash
clawdbot onboard
clawdbot health
```

2. Start the gateway and confirm it is reachable locally.
```bash
clawdbot gateway --port 18789 --verbose
```

3. Connect one messaging channel and run a small workflow end-to-end.
Keep the scope small, measure latency, and expand only after you confirm stable behavior.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|---|---|
| Command not found | Ensure Node.js 22+ is installed and your PATH is updated. |
| Gateway not reachable | Confirm the gateway is bound to loopback and port 18789 is free. |
| Auth errors | Verify API keys and rotate them if they may be exposed. |
| Slow responses | Reduce active skills, test a smaller model, and review logs. |
| Messages not delivered | Re-check channel tokens and allow-lists. |

## Conclusion

Choose the deployment model that matches your current scale. Start simple, validate your workflows, and only then move to more complex infrastructure. Moltbot is flexible enough to grow with you, whether that means a single VPS or a multi-node Kubernetes cluster.

## Additional Notes

Moltbot workflows work best when you keep inputs tight and outputs measurable.
Define success criteria for deploying moltbot: docker, kubernetes, and cloud options before you automate anything significant.

For teams, document configuration changes and run clawdbot doctor after major edits.
This keeps the gateway stable and reduces debugging time when scaling up.

Key reminders:
- Keep tokens and passwords out of version control.
- Validate the gateway locally before exposing it.
- Roll out new skills in small batches and monitor logs.
- Re-check allow-lists after any channel changes.
