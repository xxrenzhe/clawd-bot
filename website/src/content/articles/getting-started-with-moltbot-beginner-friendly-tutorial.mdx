# Getting Started with Moltbot: Beginner-Friendly Tutorial

![Getting started with Moltbot](/images/articles/getting-started-with-moltbot-beginner-friendly-tutorial.jpg)

## Introduction

If you want a personal AI assistant that runs on your own infrastructure, Moltbot (also known as Clawdbot/Openclaw) is a practical starting point. It gives you a self-hosted gateway to LLMs, supports popular messaging apps, and keeps your data under your control.

This tutorial covers the minimum steps to get a working setup: install, onboard, run the gateway, and connect your first workflow. You can expand later into advanced automations.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- A machine with Node.js 22+ installed
- An API key for the model you want to use
- Access to a terminal on macOS, Linux, or Windows (WSL)

If you are deploying to a server, ensure the machine has at least 2GB RAM and stable network access.

## Step 1: Install Moltbot (verified commands)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://clawd.bot/install.sh | bash
clawdbot onboard
clawdbot health
```

The onboarding step guides you through basic configuration and creates the initial gateway setup.

## Step 2: Start the gateway

```bash
clawdbot gateway --port 18789 --verbose
```

The gateway is the runtime that connects your assistant to models and integrations. Keep it running while you test workflows.

## Step 3: Connect a messaging app

Moltbot supports messaging platforms like Telegram, Discord, and Slack. Start with the channel you already use daily. If you need a walkthrough, check:

- [Multi-platform messaging](/articles/multi-platform-messaging-with-moltbot-telegram-discord-slack)
- [Discord setup](/articles/clawdbot-discord-bot)
- [Slack integration](/articles/clawdbot-slack-integration)

## Step 4: Create your first workflow

Begin with a small workflow that is easy to verify. Examples:

- Daily summary of tasks or notes
- Simple inbox triage labels
- Weekly checklist generation

A reliable workflow has three parts: capture, process, and deliver. Capture inputs, process them with Moltbot, and deliver the output where you will actually use it.

## Choosing your first model

If you are new to AI automation, start with a hosted model for accuracy and consistency. Once your workflow is stable, consider experimenting with local models to reduce costs. The best path is usually incremental: get one workflow working, then test alternatives side by side. This keeps quality high while you explore options.

## Security basics

Because Moltbot is self-hosted, you control security. Start with these defaults:

- Bind the gateway to loopback to avoid public exposure.
- Use pairing mode for messaging integrations.
- Store API keys as secrets and rotate them regularly.

See [security best practices](/articles/clawdbot-security-best-practices) for a full checklist.

## Troubleshooting quick fixes

| Issue | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Gateway not responding | Port conflict | Change port or stop the conflicting service |
| Commands fail | Old Node.js | Upgrade to Node.js 22+ |
| Output quality low | Prompt too broad | Add examples and tighten the prompt |

## Next steps

Once the basics work, expand intentionally:

- Add more workflows only after the first one is reliable
- Introduce monitoring to catch regressions
- Explore advanced features like RAG and custom skills

- [RAG implementation](/articles/clawdbot-rag-implementation)

## First-week checklist

Use this checklist during your first week to build confidence:

- Run the gateway for at least one hour a day.
- Test one workflow end-to-end and log the result.
- Review outputs for accuracy and consistency.
- Tighten prompts where the output drifts.

If the workflow feels stable after a week, add a second automation. The goal is consistency, not volume.

## Common beginner mistakes

- **Trying to automate too much at once**: start with one workflow and scale later.
- **Skipping validation**: review outputs until quality is predictable.
- **No clear output format**: specify the structure you want in the prompt.

## Beginner FAQ

**Do I need a server?**  
You can start on your local machine. If you want 24/7 access, move to a VPS later.

**Which model should I use?**  
Start with a hosted model for accuracy. Once your workflow is stable, consider local models for cost control.

**How do I know it is working?**  
Your first success signal is a workflow that runs end-to-end without manual fixes. Measure time saved weekly.

If you feel unsure, keep the workflow scope small and iterate once per week instead of every day.

## Free installation service

## Conclusion

You now have a working foundation for a self-hosted assistant. Start small, validate outputs, and scale your workflows as you gain confidence. Moltbot makes it easy to keep your data private while still benefiting from modern AI automation.

## Additional Notes

Moltbot workflows work best when you keep inputs tight and outputs measurable.
Define success criteria for getting started with moltbot: beginner-friendly tutorial before you automate anything significant.

For teams, document configuration changes and run clawdbot doctor after major edits.
This keeps the gateway stable and reduces debugging time when scaling up.

Key reminders:
- Keep tokens and passwords out of version control.
- Validate the gateway locally before exposing it.
- Roll out new skills in small batches and monitor logs.
- Re-check allow-lists after any channel changes.
