**My Approach to Crafting the Moltbot Tutorial**

Okay, here's how I'm going to approach this tutorial. I'm focusing on creating a comprehensive, beginner-friendly guide to Moltbot (aka Clawdbot or Openclaw), a self-hosted AI gateway. My goal is a complete MDX article, clocking in between 1500 and 2500 words, aiming for a professional yet approachable tone.

First, the essentials. I'll start with the frontmatter, ensuring it's spot-on: `title`, `description`, etc. I'll be using the provided title and description to make sure that the article is well optimized for search. The structure will follow the proposed outline, but I will elaborate significantly on each section. This is not a summary; this will be an education. I'll make sure to integrate the `HostingCTA` components throughout to promote their free installation service.

The hook is crucial: I want to capture the reader's attention with the idea of truly owning their AI experience. I'll introduce Openclaw/Moltbot/Clawdbot right away.

I'm thinking: Why not begin with the privacy concerns surrounding modern AI? It's a relatable starting point. Then, I'll explain how Moltbot is the solution. My introduction is set.

For the core content, I plan to dive deep. What is an AI gateway? Why *should* you self-host? I'll need to really unpack that for the user. Then, I will provide a real guide.

**The Breakdown**

I will start with a clear "Prerequisites" section, covering the server requirements and the API key. Then I'll dive into the steps.

*   **Installation**: The `curl` command needs to be explained. I need to break down *what* the shell script does.
*   **Onboarding**: I will explain what happens during `onboard`.
*   **Configuration**: I am going to have to dive into gateway settings and explain the importance of each.
*   **Connecting Platforms**: I'll cover the specifics: Getting a Telegram token, how Discord apps are created and work.
*   **Security**: I need to focus on this, explaining why loopback binding is essential, and why pairing mode is safer than leaving the gateway open.

I'll also include a section on advanced features: local LLMs and the concept of "skills". I'll wrap it up with troubleshooting (explaining the `health` check) and a brief conclusion, perhaps hinting at the future of Moltbot.

**Word Count & Strategy**

To reach the target word count, I will make sure that I provide in-depth details of each step. I'll go beyond basic instructions, explaining *why* each step is important. I'll also explain the architecture of an AI gateway.

I'm aiming to break the word count into logical segments:

*   Introduction: 200 words
*   What is Moltbot/Clawdbot/Openclaw?: 300 words
*   Prerequisites: 150 words
*   Installation: 250 words
*   Onboarding & Configuration: 300 words
*   Messaging Platforms: 350 words
*   Security: 300 words
*   Advanced Features/Skills: 200 words
*   Conclusion/Troubleshooting: 150 words

That totals roughly 2200 words.

**Content Focus**

I need to keep the tone beginner-friendly, avoiding jargon or explaining it when needed. And, I will need to use "moltbot tutorial", "openclaw", and "clawdbot" consistently for SEO purposes. This requires the use of CTAs. The MDX imports are essential, and the specific commands need to be accurate.

I also will need to provide a very detailed breakdown of the `config.yaml` or equivalent settings. I'll explain the difference between a "provider" and a "gateway", and perhaps provide a walkthrough of a "First Interaction" scenario.

**The Final Steps**

I'll meticulously double-check all verified commands, making sure they're accurate. Those key commands will be:

*   Quick install: `curl -fsSL https://clawd.bot/install.sh | bash`
*   Onboarding: `clawdbot onboard`
*   Health: `clawdbot health`
*   Gateway: `clawdbot gateway --port 18789 --verbose`

Finally, before starting, I must remember to *avoid meta-commentary* and start directly with the content.
