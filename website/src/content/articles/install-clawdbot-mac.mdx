# Install Moltbot on Mac: 5-Minute Setup

![Installing Moltbot on macOS](/images/articles/install-clawdbot-mac.jpg)

## Quick Install (30 seconds)

```bash
# Install with Homebrew (recommended)
brew install moltbot

# Or use the official installer
curl -fsSL https://molt.bot/install.sh | bash
```

That's it. Now run the setup wizard:

```bash
moltbot onboard
```

<HostingCTA context="setup" />

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Minimum | Recommended |
|-------------|---------|-------------|
| macOS | 12 Monterey | 14 Sonoma |
| Node.js | 22+ | 22 LTS |
| RAM | 2GB | 4GB+ |
| Storage | 500MB | 1GB |

**Check your setup:**
```bash
node --version  # Should show v22.x or higher
```

**Install Node.js if needed:**
```bash
brew install node@22
```

## Installation Options

### Option 1: Homebrew (Recommended)

```bash
brew install moltbot
```

Homebrew handles updates automatically. To update later:
```bash
brew upgrade moltbot
```

### Option 2: Official Installer

```bash
curl -fsSL https://molt.bot/install.sh | bash
```

> **Note**: Review the script at https://molt.bot/install.sh before running.

### Option 3: npm

```bash
npm install -g moltbot
```

## Initial Setup

Run the onboarding wizard:

```bash
moltbot onboard
```

The wizard will:
1. Create `~/.moltbot/moltbot.json` config file
2. Ask for your Anthropic API key (for Claude)
3. Optionally set up Telegram or Discord

## Add Your API Key

Get a Claude API key from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com).

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
```

Add to your shell profile (`~/.zshrc` for most Mac users):
```bash
echo 'export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

<HostingCTA context="inline" />

## Verify Installation

```bash
moltbot health
```

Expected output:
```
✓ Gateway healthy
✓ Claude API connected
✓ Config valid
```

Run the doctor for detailed diagnostics:
```bash
moltbot doctor
```

## Connect Telegram (Optional)

1. Open Telegram, search for @BotFather
2. Send `/newbot` and follow prompts
3. Copy the token BotFather gives you

```bash
moltbot configure --section channels.telegram
# Paste your bot token when prompted
```

## Apple Silicon Notes (M1/M2/M3/M4)

Moltbot runs natively on Apple Silicon—no Rosetta needed. If you encounter issues:

```bash
# Verify you're running ARM64 Node
node -p "process.arch"  # Should show "arm64"
```

If it shows "x64", reinstall Node via Homebrew:
```bash
brew uninstall node
brew install node@22
```

## Running at Startup

To keep Moltbot running after logout:

```bash
moltbot gateway install
```

This creates a LaunchAgent that starts Moltbot on login.

**Manual control:**
```bash
moltbot gateway start
moltbot gateway stop
moltbot gateway status
```

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| `command not found: moltbot` | Add `/opt/homebrew/bin` to PATH or restart terminal |
| `Node.js version too old` | `brew install node@22` |
| `Permission denied` | Don't use sudo; fix npm permissions |
| `Gateway fails to start` | Check port 18789: `lsof -i :18789` |
| `API key invalid` | Verify at console.anthropic.com |

## Additional Notes

Moltbot workflows work best when you keep inputs tight and outputs measurable.
Define success criteria for install moltbot on mac: 5-minute setup before you automate anything significant.

For teams, document configuration changes and run clawdbot doctor after major edits.
This keeps the gateway stable and reduces debugging time when scaling up.

Key reminders:
- Keep tokens and passwords out of version control.
- Validate the gateway locally before exposing it.
- Roll out new skills in small batches and monitor logs.
- Re-check allow-lists after any channel changes.
