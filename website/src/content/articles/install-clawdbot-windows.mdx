# Install Moltbot on Windows with WSL2

![Installing Moltbot on Windows with WSL2](/images/articles/install-clawdbot-windows.jpg)

## Quick Install (5 minutes)

```powershell
# In PowerShell (Admin)
wsl --install -d Ubuntu

# After restart, in Ubuntu terminal
curl -fsSL https://molt.bot/install.sh | bash
moltbot onboard
```

## Why WSL2?

Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot) runs on Linux. WSL2 gives you a full Linux environment inside Windows:

| Method | Performance | Compatibility | Setup Effort |
|--------|-------------|---------------|--------------|
| WSL2 (recommended) | Native Linux speed | Full support | Low |
| Docker Desktop | Slightly slower | Full support | Medium |
| Native Windows | Not supported | — | — |

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | How to Check |
|-------------|--------------|
| Windows 10 (2004+) or 11 | Settings → System → About |
| Virtualization enabled | Task Manager → Performance → CPU → Virtualization: Enabled |
| Admin access | Required for WSL installation |

## Step 1: Install WSL2

Open PowerShell as Administrator:

```powershell
wsl --install -d Ubuntu
```

This installs:
- WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
- Ubuntu distribution
- Required virtualization components

**Restart your computer** when prompted.

## Step 2: Set Up Ubuntu

After restart, Ubuntu terminal opens automatically. Create your username and password.

**Update packages:**
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

## Step 3: Install Node.js 22

```bash
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_22.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

Verify:
```bash
node --version  # Should show v22.x
```

## Step 4: Install Moltbot

```bash
curl -fsSL https://molt.bot/install.sh | bash
```

Or via npm:
```bash
npm install -g moltbot
```

## Step 5: Run Setup

```bash
moltbot onboard
```

The wizard prompts for:
- Anthropic API key (get from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com))
- Optional messaging channels (Telegram, Discord)

## Step 6: Verify

```bash
moltbot health
```

Expected output:
```
✓ Gateway healthy
✓ Claude API connected
✓ Config valid
```

## Windows Terminal Integration

For a better experience, use [Windows Terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-terminal/9N0DX20HK701):

1. Install from Microsoft Store
2. Open Windows Terminal
3. Click dropdown → Ubuntu
4. Now you have a proper Linux terminal

**Pin to taskbar:** Right-click Windows Terminal → Pin to taskbar

## Access Files Between Windows and WSL

| Location | Path |
|----------|------|
| Windows files from WSL | `/mnt/c/Users/YourName/` |
| WSL files from Windows | `\\wsl$\Ubuntu\home\yourname\` |

Access your Moltbot config:
```bash
# From Windows Explorer
\\wsl$\Ubuntu\home\yourname\.moltbot\
```

## Run Moltbot at Windows Startup

Create a scheduled task to start the gateway:

**Option 1: WSL command at login**
```powershell
# PowerShell (Admin)
$action = New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute "wsl" -Argument "-d Ubuntu -e moltbot gateway"
$trigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -AtLogon
Register-ScheduledTask -TaskName "Moltbot" -Action $action -Trigger $trigger
```

**Option 2: Create a batch file**
```batch
@echo off
wsl -d Ubuntu -e moltbot gateway
```
Save as `moltbot.bat` and add to Startup folder.

## Connect Telegram

```bash
moltbot configure --section channels.telegram
```

Steps:
1. Open Telegram, search for @BotFather
2. Send `/newbot`, follow prompts
3. Copy the token
4. Paste when prompted by Moltbot

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| `WSL installation failed` | Enable virtualization in BIOS/UEFI |
| `command not found: moltbot` | Run `source ~/.bashrc` or restart terminal |
| `Node version too old` | Reinstall Node.js 22 using instructions above |
| `Port already in use` | WSL: `sudo lsof -i :18789` then kill the process |
| `WSL won't start` | PowerShell: `wsl --shutdown` then reopen Ubuntu |

**Check WSL status:**
```powershell
wsl --status
wsl --list --verbose
```

## Performance Tips

1. **Store projects in WSL filesystem** (`~/projects/`), not Windows (`/mnt/c/`). I/O is faster.
2. **Allocate more memory:** Create `~/.wslconfig` in Windows home:
```ini
[wsl2]
memory=4GB
processors=2
```
3. **Restart WSL after config changes:** `wsl --shutdown`

## Additional Notes

Moltbot workflows work best when you keep inputs tight and outputs measurable.
Define success criteria for install moltbot on windows with wsl2 before you automate anything significant.

For teams, document configuration changes and run clawdbot doctor after major edits.
This keeps the gateway stable and reduces debugging time when scaling up.

Key reminders:
- Keep tokens and passwords out of version control.
- Validate the gateway locally before exposing it.
- Roll out new skills in small batches and monitor logs.
- Re-check allow-lists after any channel changes.
