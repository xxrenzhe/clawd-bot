# Integrating Moltbot with Your Existing Tools and APIs

![Integrating Moltbot with existing tools and APIs](/images/articles/integrating-moltbot-with-your-existing-tools-and-apis.jpg)

## Introduction

Moltbot (Clawdbot/Openclaw) is most valuable when it sits in the middle of your existing tools. Instead of replacing your stack, it connects to it: pulling data from APIs, summarizing activity, and delivering results where your team works.

This tutorial shows integration patterns that are reliable and easy to maintain. You will set up a simple integration loop, then expand to webhooks and scheduled jobs.

## Integration patterns that work

Most practical integrations fall into a few patterns:

- **Webhook in, summary out**: capture events, produce a summary, send to chat.
- **Scheduled digest**: run a daily or weekly summary from multiple sources.
- **Task pipeline**: take structured inputs, enrich them, and push to another system.

These patterns are durable because they keep the automation small and auditable.

## Quick setup (verified commands)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://clawd.bot/install.sh | bash
clawdbot onboard
clawdbot health
clawdbot gateway --port 18789 --verbose
```

## Example integration workflow

A simple workflow might look like this:

1. A tool posts an event (new ticket, new issue, new lead).
2. Moltbot summarizes the event and labels priority.
3. The summary is pushed to a chat channel or dashboard.

This flow is easy to verify and does not require you to automate final decisions. The goal is to reduce time spent on manual triage.

## Recommended integration targets

Start with tools that already create structured data:

- Issue trackers (Jira, GitHub)
- Customer support tools
- CI/CD or build pipelines
- CRM and lead pipelines

For internal guides, see [GitHub integration](/articles/clawdbot-github-integration) and [Jira automation](/articles/clawdbot-jira-automation).

## Designing reliable payloads

When you connect to external tools, normalize inputs so Moltbot can reason consistently. A good payload includes:

- Title or summary
- Priority or severity
- Owner or team
- Links to original data

Keep it small and predictable. Large payloads make the assistant slower and harder to debug.

## Testing and rollout strategy

Integrations are easier to trust when you roll them out in stages:

1. **Dry run**: send events to a sandbox channel and verify outputs.
2. **Shadow mode**: generate summaries without acting on them.
3. **Limited rollout**: start with one team or one workflow.
4. **Full deployment**: expand only after quality is stable.

This phased rollout reduces risk and makes it easier to pinpoint errors if something goes wrong.

## Data quality guardrails

Bad inputs lead to unreliable automation. To improve data quality:

- Remove duplicate fields and noisy logs.
- Standardize timestamps and IDs.
- Keep only the fields that change decisions.

Better inputs reduce prompt complexity and make outputs more consistent.

## Change management for integrations

When workflows change, update them like you would a small service:\n\n- Document the change and why it was made.\n- Notify the users who rely on the output.\n- Roll out updates during low-traffic periods.\n\nThis keeps integrations stable and reduces surprises for your team.

## Security and access control

Integrations should be secure by default:

- Limit inbound requests to trusted IPs.
- Use tokens or signatures for webhooks.
- Avoid logging secrets in plain text.

Combine this with [security best practices](/articles/clawdbot-security-best-practices) and [network setup](/articles/clawdbot-network-setup) for a complete baseline.

## Troubleshooting checklist

| Issue | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Missing events | Webhook not firing | Validate URL and token |
| Slow responses | Oversized payloads | Reduce fields, batch events |
| Inconsistent output | Inputs too noisy | Normalize and add examples |

## Integration ideas to start with

If you are not sure where to begin, try one of these low-risk automations:

- Summarize new support tickets and post to a team channel.
- Create a daily digest of GitHub issues and pull requests.
- Convert meeting notes into a short action list.
- Classify incoming leads and tag by priority.

These workflows provide quick wins and are easy to validate.
Start with one automation and expand only after output quality is stable.

## Conclusion

The best integrations are simple, predictable, and easy to verify. Start with one workflow, measure the impact, and expand only after it is reliable. Moltbot gives you a self-hosted foundation for integrations that keeps your data in your control.
