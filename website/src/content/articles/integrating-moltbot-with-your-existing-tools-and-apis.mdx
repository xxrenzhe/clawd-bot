# Integrating Moltbot with Your Existing Tools and APIs

![Integrating Moltbot with existing tools and APIs](/images/articles/integrating-moltbot-with-your-existing-tools-and-apis.jpg)

## Introduction

Moltbot (Clawdbot/Openclaw) is most valuable when it sits in the middle of your existing tools. Instead of replacing your stack, it connects to it: pulling data from APIs, summarizing activity, and delivering results where your team works.

This tutorial shows integration patterns that are reliable and easy to maintain. You will set up a simple integration loop, then expand to webhooks and scheduled jobs.

<HostingCTA context="setup" />

## Integration patterns that work

Most practical integrations fall into a few patterns:

- **Webhook in, summary out**: capture events, produce a summary, send to chat.
- **Scheduled digest**: run a daily or weekly summary from multiple sources.
- **Task pipeline**: take structured inputs, enrich them, and push to another system.

These patterns are durable because they keep the automation small and auditable.

## Quick setup (verified commands)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://clawd.bot/install.sh | bash
clawdbot onboard
clawdbot health
clawdbot gateway --port 18789 --verbose
```

## Example integration workflow

A simple workflow might look like this:

1. A tool posts an event (new ticket, new issue, new lead).
2. Moltbot summarizes the event and labels priority.
3. The summary is pushed to a chat channel or dashboard.

This flow is easy to verify and does not require you to automate final decisions. The goal is to reduce time spent on manual triage.

## Recommended integration targets

Start with tools that already create structured data:

- Issue trackers (Jira, GitHub)
- Customer support tools
- CI/CD or build pipelines
- CRM and lead pipelines

For internal guides, see [GitHub integration](/articles/clawdbot-github-integration) and [Jira automation](/articles/clawdbot-jira-automation).

## Designing reliable payloads

When you connect to external tools, normalize inputs so Moltbot can reason consistently. A good payload includes:

- Title or summary
- Priority or severity
- Owner or team
- Links to original data

Keep it small and predictable. Large payloads make the assistant slower and harder to debug.

## Testing and rollout strategy

Integrations are easier to trust when you roll them out in stages:

1. **Dry run**: send events to a sandbox channel and verify outputs.
2. **Shadow mode**: generate summaries without acting on them.
3. **Limited rollout**: start with one team or one workflow.
4. **Full deployment**: expand only after quality is stable.

This phased rollout reduces risk and makes it easier to pinpoint errors if something goes wrong.

## Data quality guardrails

Bad inputs lead to unreliable automation. To improve data quality:

- Remove duplicate fields and noisy logs.
- Standardize timestamps and IDs.
- Keep only the fields that change decisions.

Better inputs reduce prompt complexity and make outputs more consistent.

## Change management for integrations

When workflows change, update them like you would a small service:\n\n- Document the change and why it was made.\n- Notify the users who rely on the output.\n- Roll out updates during low-traffic periods.\n\nThis keeps integrations stable and reduces surprises for your team.

## Security and access control

Integrations should be secure by default:

- Limit inbound requests to trusted IPs.
- Use tokens or signatures for webhooks.
- Avoid logging secrets in plain text.

Combine this with [security best practices](/articles/clawdbot-security-best-practices) and [network setup](/articles/clawdbot-network-setup) for a complete baseline.

## Troubleshooting checklist

| Issue | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Missing events | Webhook not firing | Validate URL and token |
| Slow responses | Oversized payloads | Reduce fields, batch events |
| Inconsistent output | Inputs too noisy | Normalize and add examples |

## Integration ideas to start with

If you are not sure where to begin, try one of these low-risk automations:

- Summarize new support tickets and post to a team channel.
- Create a daily digest of GitHub issues and pull requests.
- Convert meeting notes into a short action list.
- Classify incoming leads and tag by priority.

These workflows provide quick wins and are easy to validate.
Start with one automation and expand only after output quality is stable.

## Free installation service

We offer a free Moltbot installation service. Get started at [Contact](/contact).

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| Node.js | 22+ (check: node --version) |
| OS | macOS, Linux, Windows (via WSL2) |
| Memory | 2GB RAM minimum (4GB+ recommended for browser automation) |
| Storage | 500MB for installation |

If you are already running Moltbot, you can skip installation and focus on configuration and workflows.

## How to apply this topic

> ⚠️ Review install scripts before running them in production. Avoid committing API keys or secrets to version control.

1. Install and onboard if you are new to the platform.
```bash
curl -fsSL https://clawd.bot/install.sh | bash
clawdbot onboard
clawdbot health
```

2. Start the gateway and confirm it is reachable locally.
```bash
clawdbot gateway --port 18789 --verbose
```

3. Connect one messaging channel and run a small workflow end-to-end.
Keep the scope small, measure latency, and expand only after you confirm stable behavior.

## Conclusion

The best integrations are simple, predictable, and easy to verify. Start with one workflow, measure the impact, and expand only after it is reliable. Moltbot gives you a self-hosted foundation for integrations that keeps your data in your control.

## Additional Notes

Moltbot workflows work best when you keep inputs tight and outputs measurable.
Define success criteria for integrating moltbot with your existing tools and apis before you automate anything significant.

For teams, document configuration changes and run clawdbot doctor after major edits.
This keeps the gateway stable and reduces debugging time when scaling up.

Key reminders:
- Keep tokens and passwords out of version control.
- Validate the gateway locally before exposing it.
- Roll out new skills in small batches and monitor logs.
- Re-check allow-lists after any channel changes.
