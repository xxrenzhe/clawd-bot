In an era of digital fragmentation, our communication is scattered across a dozen different ecosystems. We use Telegram for privacy, Discord for community, and Slack for professional collaboration. For the power user, this fragmentation presents a challenge: how do you bring the intelligence of Large Language Models (LLMs) into every conversation without sacrificing privacy or repeating setup across every platform?

Enter **Moltbot** (also known as **Clawdbot** or **Openclaw**). 

Moltbot is a revolutionary, open-source, self-hosted AI gateway designed to unify your messaging experience. Unlike standard SaaS bots that lock you into a single provider or harvest your data, Moltbot acts as a private bridge. It connects your preferred chat applications—Telegram, Discord, Slack, and even WhatsApp—to high-performance AI models like Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4o, or locally hosted models via Ollama. 

In this comprehensive guide, we will explore how to set up Moltbot as your central messaging hub, ensuring that your personal AI assistant is always just a message away, regardless of the platform you choose.

## Understanding the Moltbot Architecture

Before diving into the installation, it is crucial to understand what makes **Openclaw** (the engine behind Moltbot) different from traditional bot frameworks. 

Most bots are "dumb" interfaces—they receive a message, send it to an API, and return the answer. Moltbot is an **AI Gateway**. It manages:
1.  **Identity:** One assistant identity across multiple platforms.
2.  **Memory:** File-based persistence that ensures your bot remembers previous context, whether you spoke to it on Discord or Telegram.
3.  **Skills:** Extensible plugins that allow the bot to browse the web, execute code, or control your local computer.
4.  **Privacy:** Because it is self-hosted, your API keys and conversation history never touch a third-party server (other than the LLM provider itself).

By deploying **Clawdbot**, you are creating a private infrastructure that you own entirely.

## Initial Installation and Core Setup

The beauty of Moltbot lies in its streamlined deployment process. Whether you are running this on a local Raspberry Pi, a home server, or a VPS, the process begins with a single command.

### 1. The Quick Install
To begin, use the verified installation script:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://clawd.bot/install.sh | bash
```

This script detects your environment, installs necessary dependencies, and prepares the `clawdbot` binary. Once installed, you need to configure your core settings—specifically your LLM provider (like Anthropic for Claude) and your primary messaging platform.

### 2. Onboarding
Run the interactive onboarding tool to set up your primary credentials:

```bash
clawdbot onboard
```

During this process, you will be asked to provide your API keys. Moltbot supports:
- **Anthropic (Claude):** Recommended for its reasoning capabilities.
- **OpenAI (GPT-4o):** Excellent for general tasks.
- **Ollama:** For those who want to run models locally (e.g., Llama 3 or Mistral) for 100% offline privacy.

### 3. Verification
Before connecting messaging platforms, ensure the core system is healthy:

```bash
clawdbot health
```

If all lights are green, you are ready to expand Moltbot into your favorite chat apps.

## Integrating Telegram: The Ultimate Private Companion

Telegram is the most popular choice for Moltbot users due to its robust Bot API and ease of use. A **Telegram bot** powered by Moltbot can act as your personal researcher, scheduler, and gatekeeper.

### Setup Steps:
1.  **Create the Bot:** Message `@BotFather` on Telegram. Use the `/newbot` command and follow the instructions to get your **HTTP API Token**.
2.  **Configure Moltbot:** Edit your `config.yaml` or use the environment variables to add your Telegram token.
3.  **Launch the Gateway:** Start Moltbot to begin listening for messages:

```bash
clawdbot gateway --port 18789 --verbose
```

### Advanced Telegram Features
Moltbot supports both Direct Messages (DMs) and Group Chats. In groups, you can mention the bot to trigger its intelligence, making it a collaborative tool for your friends or team.

## Connecting Discord: The Community Powerhouse

For those who live in Discord servers, a **Discord bot** integration allows Moltbot to manage community interactions, answer technical questions, or summarize long threads.

### Setup Steps:
1.  **Discord Developer Portal:** Create a new Application at the Discord Developer Portal.
2.  **Bot User:** Create a Bot user and enable the `Message Content Intent`—this is vital, as Moltbot needs to read messages to respond to them.
3.  **Permissions:** Grant the bot `Send Messages`, `Read Message History`, and `Embed Links`.
4.  **Integration:** Add the Discord Token to your Moltbot configuration.

Unlike simpler bots, a **Moltbot messaging** setup on Discord allows for complex "Skills." For example, you can give Moltbot the ability to summarize the last 50 messages in a channel to get you up to speed.

## Integrating Slack: Professional AI Automation

In a professional environment, **Slack bot** integration is about productivity. Moltbot can help draft emails, debug code snippets shared in channels, or manage project timelines.

### Setup Steps:
1.  **Slack App:** Create an app at `api.slack.com`.
2.  **Socket Mode:** We highly recommend enabling **Socket Mode**. This allows Moltbot to communicate with Slack without needing a public URL or complex firewall rules.
3.  **Scopes:** Add `chat:write`, `app_mentions:read`, and `im:history`.
4.  **App Token:** Generate an App-level token (starting with `xapp-`) and a Bot-level token (starting with `xoxb-`).

With Moltbot on Slack, your team gains a persistent AI member that maintains context across threads, significantly improving the quality of AI-assisted work.

## Security Best Practices for Self-Hosting

Since Moltbot/Openclaw has the power to access your local files and execute commands (if enabled), security is paramount. When running a self-hosted gateway, follow these verified security protocols:

### 1. Network Binding
By default, ensure the gateway is not exposed to the open internet unless necessary. 
- **Recommendation:** Bind `gateway.bind` to "loopback" (127.0.0.1). If you need external access, use a VPN (like Tailscale) or a reverse proxy.

### 2. Device Pairing
Moltbot features a "Pairing" mode for DM policy. Instead of allowing anyone who finds your bot to use your LLM credits, you can require a manual approval process for every new device or user ID that attempts to communicate with your instance.

### 3. Authentication
Always configure a password for the gateway interface:
```yaml
gateway:
  auth:
    password: "your-strong-password-here"
```

### 4. Reverse Proxy and Trusted Proxies
If you are using Nginx or Caddy to manage your Moltbot instance, ensure you configure `gateway.trustedProxies`. This ensures that Moltbot correctly identifies the source IP of incoming requests, which is critical for rate limiting and logging.

## The Power of Unified Memory

The true "killer feature" of **Clawdbot** is unified, file-based memory. If you start a research project with Moltbot on your Desktop via Slack, and then head out for lunch, you can pick up exactly where you left off on Telegram from your phone.

Because Moltbot stores its memory locally in structured files, the LLM is fed the relevant context regardless of the "entry point." This transforms the AI from a disposable chat interface into a long-term digital twin that grows with you.

## Extensibility: Beyond Simple Chat

Moltbot is not limited to text. Through its "Skills" system, it becomes an agent. You can configure:
- **File Access:** Send a PDF to the bot on Telegram; ask it to summarize the PDF on Discord.
- **Computer Use:** (Experimental) Give Moltbot permission to execute terminal commands or interact with your OS.
- **Web Search:** Enable the bot to browse the live web to provide up-to-date information, bypassing the knowledge cutoff of standard LLMs.

## Troubleshooting and Health Checks

If you encounter issues with your multi-platform setup, use the following commands to diagnose:

- **Check Connectivity:** `clawdbot health` checks if the bot can reach the LLM provider and the messaging platform APIs.
- **Verbose Logging:** Run the gateway with the `--verbose` flag to see real-time interaction logs. This is particularly helpful for debugging Discord "Intents" or Slack "Scope" issues.
- **Configuration Check:** Ensure your `config.yaml` is valid YAML. Even a single missing space can prevent the gateway from starting.

We offer a free Moltbot installation service at [Contact](/contact) if you prefer to have an expert handle the technical heavy lifting for you.

## Why Choose Moltbot Over SaaS Alternatives?

You might wonder why you should go through the effort of self-hosting **Openclaw** when you could just use a pre-made bot from a marketplace. The answer lies in three pillars:

1.  **Cost:** You only pay for the raw tokens you use. There is no monthly "Pro" subscription fee.
2.  **Privacy:** Your data is yours. It isn't used to train a global model, and it isn't sold to advertisers.
3.  **Control:** You choose the model. Want to use Claude 3 Opus for complex logic today and a local Llama 3 for simple tasks tomorrow? Moltbot makes that switch seamless.

## Conclusion

Setting up **Moltbot** across Telegram, Discord, and Slack is more than just a technical exercise—it is the creation of a personalized, private AI infrastructure. By following the verified commands and security best practices outlined in this guide, you can move away from fragmented, platform-locked AI and toward a unified experience that respects your privacy and enhances your productivity.

Whether you are an individual power user or a developer building a collaborative environment, the **Clawdbot** gateway provides the flexibility and power needed to master the modern messaging landscape.
