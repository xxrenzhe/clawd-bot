# Moltbot Messaging: Telegram, Discord, Slack

![Moltbot Messaging: Telegram, Discord, Slack](/images/articles/multi-platform-messaging-with-moltbot-telegram-discord-slack.jpg)

## Introduction

Most teams juggle multiple chat platforms. A personal assistant trapped in one app is less useful. Moltbot (also called Clawdbot or Openclaw) solves this by acting as a single gateway that connects to Telegram, Discord, Slack, and more while keeping your data self-hosted.

This guide explains how to run one assistant across multiple platforms without duplicating workflows. It focuses on setup, routing, and reliability.

## How multi-platform messaging works

Moltbot connects messaging channels to the gateway. The gateway normalizes events, applies memory and tool logic, and sends responses back to the right channel. This keeps your workflow consistent even when your team uses different apps.

The benefit is simple: one assistant, many channels, one set of workflows.

## Install and run the gateway

Start with a clean install:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://clawd.bot/install.sh | bash
clawdbot onboard
clawdbot health
```

Run the gateway on a stable port:

```bash
clawdbot gateway --port 18789 --verbose
```

If you are new, see [getting started with Moltbot](/articles/getting-started-with-moltbot-beginner-friendly-tutorial).

## Telegram setup overview

Telegram is great for personal assistants and lightweight automation. The basic flow is:

1. Create a bot and generate a token.
2. Pair the bot with your gateway.
3. Send a test message and verify responses.

Start small and expand after you have a stable workflow.

## Discord setup overview

Discord works well for team workflows and community support. The key steps are:

1. Create an app in the developer portal.
2. Enable the required message permissions.
3. Invite the bot to your server and pair it.

Discord is ideal for structured commands and workflow automation.

## Slack setup overview

Slack is best for internal operations and project automation. Typical steps include:

1. Create an app and enable bot permissions.
2. Configure event subscriptions.
3. Pair the bot with your gateway.

Slack is strong for structured updates, summaries, and team coordination.

## Routing and formatting across channels

Each channel has different formatting rules. Keep messages readable by:

- Using short paragraphs and bullet lists
- Avoiding heavy Markdown in Slack
- Keeping code blocks brief

If you need a channel-specific template, add it as a prompt variant instead of duplicating the whole workflow.

## Channel-specific behaviors

Messaging platforms differ in how they handle:

- File attachments and previews
- Threading and replies
- Mentions and notifications

Design for the strictest channel first, then enhance for others. This prevents formatting errors and missing information.

## Testing across channels

Before you roll out a multi-platform workflow:

- Send test messages to each platform
- Confirm formatting, mentions, and links
- Verify that rate limits and retries are working

Small tests catch most failures before they reach users.

## Message routing rules

When multiple channels are connected, define explicit routing rules:

- Route personal messages to the requester only
- Post team updates to a shared channel
- Escalate failures to an admin channel

Routing rules prevent duplicate messages and reduce confusion.

## Incident and escalation workflows

For operational alerts, keep a dedicated workflow:

- Send an initial alert to the primary channel
- Escalate after a timeout
- Summarize resolution steps at the end

This pattern keeps urgent messages visible without spamming all channels.

## Bot identity and permissions

Treat each bot identity as a service account:

- Grant only the permissions needed for the workflow
- Use separate bots for sensitive channels
- Rotate tokens regularly

Clear boundaries reduce the blast radius of a compromised token.

## Launch checklist

Before you go live on multiple platforms:

- Verify message formatting in each channel
- Confirm routing rules and escalation paths
- Test retries and rate-limit handling
- Document who owns the workflow

This checklist keeps rollout smooth and reduces user confusion.

## Message tone guidelines

Different channels expect different tone. A good default is:

- Short, clear summaries for Slack
- Slightly more conversational replies in Telegram
- Structured responses in Discord for community support

Define tone expectations early to avoid inconsistent messaging.
If a response is long, link to a longer document instead of pasting everything.

## Accessibility considerations

Keep messages easy to scan:

- Use short paragraphs and bullet lists
- Avoid large blocks of code
- Provide clear action items

Accessibility improvements benefit every channel, not just one.
Consistency across channels reduces user confusion.

## Reliability and rate limits

Multi-platform workflows fail when you ignore limits. Make sure you:

- Retry on transient failures
- Log message delivery results
- Add rate limiting per channel

For more reliability tools, see [Clawdbot rate limiting](/articles/clawdbot-rate-limiting) and [error handling](/articles/clawdbot-error-handling).

## Example workflow: cross-channel status updates

This workflow collects daily updates and posts them to each channel:

1. Collect updates via a form or message.
2. Summarize and normalize the output.
3. Deliver a clean summary to each channel.

The same workflow can power standups, incident summaries, or weekly planning.

## Security and privacy

Because Moltbot is self-hosted, you can enforce strict controls:

- Bind the gateway to loopback or a private network.
- Use pairing mode for each channel.
- Keep credentials in environment variables.

See [Clawdbot security best practices](/articles/clawdbot-security-best-practices) for a full checklist.

## Next steps

After messaging is stable, add tools and memory:

- [Task automation](/articles/clawdbot-task-automation)
- [AI memory systems](/articles/ai-memory-systems-how-moltbot-remembers-context-across-conve)
- [Integrations with existing tools](/articles/integrating-moltbot-with-your-existing-tools-and-apis)

## Free installation service
