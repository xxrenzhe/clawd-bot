# OpenClaw Automation Playbooks: 7 Workflows That Save Hours

![OpenClaw Automation Playbooks: 7 Workflows That Save Hours](/images/articles/openclaw-automation-playbooks-7-workflows-that-save-hours.jpg)

## Introduction

OpenClaw is becoming increasingly important in modern AI workflows. Moltbot (also known as OpenClaw and Clawdbot) provides a self-hosted solution that puts you in control of your data while leveraging powerful AI capabilities.

This guide is inspired by current industry trends and will help you understand how to leverage Moltbot for openclaw and automation.

## What You'll Learn

- How to set up Moltbot for openclaw
- Best practices for guide implementation
- Real-world examples and use cases
- Security considerations and recommendations

## Why Moltbot?

Moltbot is a Open-source, self-hosted personal AI assistant that offers:

- **Self-hosted**: Your data stays on your infrastructure
- **Multi-platform**: Works with Telegram, Discord, Slack, and WhatsApp
- **Flexible**: Supports Claude, GPT-4, and local LLMs via Ollama
- **Extensible**: Custom skills and plugins for any workflow


## Architecture Overview

Moltbot keeps your data local by splitting responsibilities across four components. This separation makes it easier to secure, scale, and reason about how the system behaves.

### Gateway
Central hub that connects messaging platforms and orchestrates interactions. Acts as a switchboard channeling messages to the AI.
- Role: Message routing, AI inference calls, credential management, tool execution
- Default port: 18789

### Agent
The "brain" powered by LLMs like Claude or GPT. Responsible for context, memory, and reasoning. Operates in RPC mode.
Supported models include:
- Claude Opus 4.5 (anthropic/claude-opus-4-5, recommended for complex tasks)
- Claude Sonnet 4.5 (anthropic/claude-3-sonnet, for daily tasks)
- Claude Haiku (anthropic/claude-3-haiku-20240307, fast/cheap)
- GPT-4
- Gemini

### Skills
Optional extensions providing capabilities beyond basic chat. Defined in markdown files (~/clawd/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md).
Popular skill ideas:
- Web research
- Browser automation
- Email access (Gmail API)
- Calendar management
- Code review
- File operations

### Memory
Persistent, file-based system storing conversations, preferences, and context as actual files.
Key capabilities:
- Cross-session persistence
- User preference storage
- Workflow context
- Can be version-controlled
- Inspectable files


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|------------|---------|
| Node.js | 22+ |
| OS | macOS, Linux, Windows (via WSL2) |
| Memory | 2GB RAM minimum (4GB+ recommended for browser automation) |
| Storage | 500MB for installation |

### Installation

> Security note: The quick install uses `curl | bash`. Review the script before running in production.
> Alternative: `npm install -g ClawdBot@latest`

```bash
# Quick install
curl -fsSL https://clawd.bot/install.sh | bash

# Run onboarding wizard
clawdbot onboard

# Verify installation
clawdbot health
```






## Configuration Checklist

Key files and locations:
- clawdbot.json (main config)
- .env (environment variables)
- SOUL.md (assistant personality)
- ~/.clawdbot/ (workspace and memory)

Important environment variables:
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`
- `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`
- `BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY`
- `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`

High-impact configuration options:
- `gateway.bind`: Set to "loopback" to prevent external exposure
- `gateway.auth.password`: Set password for dashboard authentication
- `gateway.trustedProxies`: Configure trusted proxy IPs
- `channels.telegram.botToken`: Telegram bot token
- `channels.telegram.allowFrom`: Whitelist user IDs
- `routing.transcribeAudio.command`: CLI command for voice transcription
- `llm.provider`: Set to "anthropic" for Claude
- `llm.apiKey`: API key for the LLM provider

Example minimal configuration:

```json
{
  "gateway": {
    "bind": "loopback",
    "auth": {
      "password": "CHANGE_ME"
    }
  },
  "llm": {
    "provider": "anthropic",
    "apiKey": "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"
  },
  "channels": {
    "telegram": {
      "botToken": "TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN"
    }
  }
}
```



## Model Selection and Cost Control

Anthropic Claude is the recommended default because it balances quality and reliability for agent workflows.
Recommended models:
- Claude Opus 4.5 (anthropic/claude-opus-4-5): Complex reasoning
- Claude Sonnet 4.5 (anthropic/claude-3-sonnet): Daily coding
- Claude Haiku (anthropic/claude-3-haiku-20240307): Fast/cheap tasks

Other supported options:
- OpenAI: GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo (`OPENAI_API_KEY`)
- Local Models: Run offline with Ollama. Configure for offline use without API costs



## Messaging Channel Quickstart

### Telegram (Easy (recommended for beginners))
- Open Telegram and search for @BotFather
- Start a chat and run /newbot command
- Follow prompts to name your bot (must end in "bot")
- Copy the bot token provided by BotFather
- Get your user ID from @useridbot (for allowFrom restriction)
Env var: `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`

### Discord (Medium)
- Go to Discord Developer Portal: https://discord.com/developers/applications
- Create a new application
- Navigate to "Bot" section and click "Add Bot"
- Click "Reset Token" to get your bot token
- Enable required intents: Message Content Intent
Env var: `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`

### WhatsApp (Medium)
- Run: pnpm clawdbot login
- A QR code will appear in terminal
- Open WhatsApp on your phone
- Go to Settings → Linked Devices
Note: Uses WhatsApp Web protocol

### Slack (Medium)
- Create a Slack App at api.slack.com/apps
- Configure OAuth scopes
- Install to workspace
- Get Bot User OAuth Token



## Deployment Options

| Option | Best For | Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Local Machine | Run on your laptop or desktop | Easy setup, Direct access | Not 24/7 unless always on |
| Mac Mini M4 | Recommended for 24/7 home operation | Always on, Low power, Great performance, Supports iMessage | Hardware cost (~$599+) |
| Raspberry Pi 4/5 | Low-cost always-on option | Very low cost (~$35-80), Low power, Always on | Limited performance, No true sleep state |
| VPS/Cloud | Cloud deployment on providers like Hetzner, DigitalOcean, AWS | 24/7 availability, Reliable, Remote access | Monthly cost ($5+), Requires cloud knowledge |

## Security Best Practices

When working with openclaw, always follow these security guidelines:

- Bind gateway.bind to "loopback" to prevent external exposure
- Use "pairing" mode for DM policy to manually approve devices
- Configure gateway.auth.password for authentication
- Configure gateway.trustedProxies for reverse proxy setups
- Sandbox tools for group chats
- Use Tailscale or Cloudflare Tunnel for remote access (never expose ports directly)
- Never share API keys carelessly

### Key Risks

- Deep system access (file read/write, shell execution)
- Expanded attack surface when connecting LLMs to messaging
- Credential management (API keys, OAuth secrets)
- No "perfectly secure" setup possible
- Reverse proxy trust issues (localhost connections treated as trusted)
- Potential for prompt injection attacks

### Operational Recommendations

- Use dedicated email account, not personal/work
- Consider reformatted hard drive for maximum isolation
- Use fresh OS installation for sensitive deployments
- Run clawdbot doctor to check security configuration
- Keep separate CLI tool on host for troubleshooting Docker issues


## Remote Access (Safe Defaults)

Never expose Clawdbot gateway port directly to the public internet

- Tailscale: Peer-to-peer mesh VPN with end-to-end encryption
- Cloudflare Tunnel: Routes traffic through Cloudflare network as reverse proxy
