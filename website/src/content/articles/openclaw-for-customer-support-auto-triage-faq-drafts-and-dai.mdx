# Openclaw Support Automation: Triage, FAQ, Daily Summaries

The "agentic" revolution isn't just coming; it’s already sitting in your Slack workspace waiting to be put to work. As we’ve seen in recent discussions around agent architectures, the shift is moving away from simple chat interfaces toward persistent, autonomous assistants that can remember context and act on your behalf. 

If you are running a small SaaS team, you know the "Support Squeeze." You’re handling 40 to 80 tickets a day. It’s not enough to hire a full-time support lead, but it’s enough to kill your engineering productivity. You need a solution that doesn't cost $300/month per seat and doesn't ship your sensitive customer data to every third-party LLM provider under the sun.

Enter **Moltbot** (frequently called **Openclaw** or **Clawdbot**). It is a self-hosted AI gateway that bridges the gap between powerful models like Claude 3.5 Sonnet and your actual workflow. In this guide, we’ll show you how to turn Openclaw into a high-performance support tier-0 agent that triages tickets, drafts replies based on your actual docs, and keeps you sane with daily summaries.

## Why Moltbot (Openclaw) for Support?

Most AI support tools are "black boxes." You feed them your data, and you hope they don't hallucinate a refund policy that doesn't exist. **Moltbot** is different because it’s open-source and self-hosted. 

1.  **Privacy First:** Your customer tickets and internal SOPs stay on your infrastructure.
2.  **Multi-Model Flexibility:** Use Claude for high-reasoning triage, but swap to a local Llama 3 instance via Ollama for simple FAQ lookups to save costs.
3.  **File-Based Memory:** Unlike simple chatbots that "forget" the conversation, Openclaw uses persistent file-based memory. If you update your `refund_policy.md`, the bot knows it instantly.

## The Use Case: Small SaaS Support Efficiency

Imagine your team handles 60 tickets daily across Slack and email. Currently, an engineer or founder has to manually check every message, categorize it, and hunt down documentation to reply. 

We are going to build a workflow where:
- **Triage:** Every incoming message is tagged by priority (Urgent/High/Medium/Low) and category (Bug/Billing/Feature).
- **Drafting:** The bot looks at your internal workspace and drafts a reply.
- **Reporting:** At 5:00 PM, you get a DM summarizing what's still open and what the "hot topics" of the day were.

## Step 1: Installing Openclaw and Onboarding

First, we need to get the engine running. We’ll use the verified quick-install script. You’ll want to run this on a Linux VPS or a persistent home server.

```bash
# Download and install the binary
curl -fsSL https://clawd.bot/install.sh | bash

# Run the interactive onboarding wizard
clawdbot onboard
```

The `onboard` command is your best friend. It will walk you through setting up your primary LLM provider (I highly recommend Claude 3.5 Sonnet for support tasks due to its superior instruction following) and your gateway settings.

Once configured, verify everything is green:

```bash
clawdbot health
```

---

## Step 2: Connecting Your Support Channel

Openclaw supports Telegram, Discord, Slack, and WhatsApp. For a SaaS team, Slack or Discord is usually the hub.

When you run `clawdbot onboard`, you will be prompted to enter your bot tokens. 
**Pro-tip:** To keep things secure, use the "Pairing" mode for DM policy. This ensures that only team members you manually approve can interact with the bot.

In your `config.yaml` (or via the wizard), ensure your gateway is running:
```bash
clawdbot gateway --port 18789 --verbose
```

---

## Step 3: Seeding the AI Memory

This is where the magic happens. A support bot is only as good as its knowledge base. Openclaw uses a workspace memory folder.

1.  Create a folder named `/support-docs` in your Openclaw directory.
2.  Drop your `FAQ.md`, `pricing_tables.pdf`, and `refund_policy.txt` into this folder.
3.  In your Openclaw interface or config, point the memory path to this directory.

Now, when a customer asks, "Do you have a discount for non-profits?", Openclaw doesn't guess. It scans your actual documents to provide a draft.

## Step 4: Defining the Triage Checklist

We don't just want the bot to talk; we want it to organize. You can define a "System Prompt" or a specific "Skill" for triage. 

Create a file in your skills directory called `triage.md`:

```markdown
# Support Triage Skill
You are the Lead Support Triage Agent. For every incoming ticket, provide:
1. **Priority**: (Urgent/High/Medium/Low)
2. **Category**: (Bug/Billing/Onboarding/Feature Request)
3. **Owner**: (Engineering/Sales/Support)
4. **Suggested Draft**: Based on the internal memory docs.

Rules:
- If it mentions "API down" or "can't log in", Priority is Urgent.
- If it mentions "Cancel", Priority is High.
```

Test it with five sample tickets. You'll be surprised how accurately Claude handles this through the Openclaw gateway.

---

## Step 5: Scheduling the Daily Digest

This is the "CEO view." Instead of scrolling through 80 messages, you want a summary. Openclaw can be configured with a cron-style task or a simple script that queries the gateway.

Using the Openclaw API, you can trigger a summary:
```bash
# Example logic for a daily summary request
clawdbot gateway --verbose "Summarize all support tickets from the last 8 hours. Identify the top 3 recurring issues and list any 'Urgent' tickets that haven't been resolved."
```

You can set this to fire into your private #team-leads channel at the end of every shift.

---

## Security Best Practices

Because you are handling customer data, security isn't optional. Clawdbot/Openclaw provides several layers of protection:

1.  **Loopback Binding:** Set `gateway.bind` to `"127.0.0.1"`. This prevents the gateway from being exposed to the public internet unless you are using a reverse proxy.
2.  **Authentication:** Always configure `gateway.auth.password`. Do not leave your AI gateway open.
3.  **Trusted Proxies:** If you use Nginx or Cloudflare, configure `gateway.trustedProxies` so the bot can correctly identify the source of requests.
4.  **Pairing Mode:** Use the DM policy "pairing" mode. This means the first time you message the bot, it will ask for a pairing code, ensuring no random Slack user can access your internal docs.

## Comparisons: Openclaw vs. The Competition

| Feature | Openclaw (Moltbot) | Standard Zendesk AI |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data Privacy** | Full (Self-hosted) | Low (Third-party cloud) |
| **Customization** | Unlimited (Open source) | Limited to GUI options |
| **Cost** | API usage only | High monthly per-seat fees |
| **Memory** | Persistent File-based | Session-based |
| **Platforms** | Slack, Discord, WhatsApp+ | Web widget only |

## Use Case Scenario: "The Monday Morning Crunch"

It’s Monday morning. Your SaaS had a minor database hiccup over the weekend. You log into Slack and see 45 new messages. 

Without Openclaw, you spend 2 hours reading and sorting. 

With **Openclaw (Moltbot)**:
1. You see a single message in `#support-triage` tagged **"Urgent: 12 users reporting login issues."**
2. You see another 20 tickets tagged **"Closed: FAQ Sent"** because the bot automatically replied to people asking about your standard uptime policy.
3. You have a draft reply waiting for a billing dispute that correctly references your "Section 4.2" refund terms.

**Congratulations! You just saved 90 minutes of manual labor.**

## We Can Help You Build This

Setting up self-hosted AI can feel daunting if you're focused on building your product. **We offer a free Moltbot installation service** to help teams get off the ground. We’ll help you configure the gateway, set up your security parameters, and connect your first channel.

## Conclusion

The era of "dumb" support bots is over. By leveraging the power of **Openclaw/Clawdbot**, you can build a sophisticated, private, and highly efficient support machine that grows with your team. Whether you call it Moltbot or Openclaw, the result is the same: more time for you to build and less time spent in the support queue.

### Next Steps:
1.  **Install:** Run the curl command on a small VPS.
2.  **Configure:** Use `clawdbot onboard` to link your Claude API key.
3.  **Feed:** Upload your product docs to the memory folder.
4.  **Automate:** Set up your triage system prompt.
