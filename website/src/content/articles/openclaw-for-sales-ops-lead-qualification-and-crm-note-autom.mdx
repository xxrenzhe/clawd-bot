# Openclaw for Sales Ops: Lead Qualification and CRM Notes

In the fast-paced world of Sales Operations, the gap between a lead hitting your website and a sales rep actually following up is where deals go to die. We’ve all seen the trending discussions around "Agentic Architectures"—the idea that AI shouldn't just talk to us, but should *do* things for us. 

If you are a Sales Ops lead, you probably spend a significant portion of your week cleaning up CRM mess, chasing reps to update notes, or manually triaging lead forms that come into a shared Slack channel. This is where **Openclaw** (also known as **Moltbot** or **Clawdbot**) changes the game.

By deploying an open-source, self-hosted AI gateway, you can transform your Slack channel from a noisy notification stream into a proactive sales assistant that qualifies leads, summarizes buyer intent, and pushes clean data into your CRM—all while you sleep.

## Why Sales Ops is Moving to Self-Hosted AI Gateways

You might be wondering: "Why not just use a standard Zapier-to-ChatGPT integration?" 

The answer lies in **privacy, persistence, and power.** When you use Moltbot, your data doesn't just sit in a third-party cloud. You host the gateway. This means sensitive lead information, company financials, and internal sales strategies stay within your control. 

Furthermore, Openclaw allows for "File-based memory persistence." Unlike a standard API call that forgets who you are the second the request ends, Openclaw can remember previous interactions with a specific lead or company, providing your sales team with a deep, contextual history that a standard chatbot simply can't match.

## The Scenario: From Slack Chaos to CRM Clarity

Imagine this: An inbound lead form or demo request arrives in your `#sales-inbound` Slack channel via a webhook. Instead of a raw JSON dump that everyone ignores, Openclaw wakes up. 

It analyzes the lead's company size, checks their message against your qualification checklist (BANT or MEDDIC), summarizes their intent, and—the kicker—automatically creates or updates the record in your CRM with a structured note.

Here is how you build it.

## Step 1: Install Openclaw and Connect Slack

First, you need to get the engine running. Openclaw is designed to be lightweight and easy to deploy. We’ll use the verified quick-install method.

Open your terminal on your server (or local machine for testing) and run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://clawd.bot/install.sh | bash
```

Once the installation is complete, you need to link your sales Slack channel. Run the onboarding command:

```bash
clawdbot onboard
```

Follow the prompts to select **Slack** as your messaging platform. You will need to create a Slack App in your workspace and provide the Bot Token and App Level Token. During this process, ensure the bot is invited to your `#sales-inbound` channel.

## Step 2: Ingesting Lead Data

For Openclaw to qualify a lead, it needs to "see" the data. Most lead forms (Typeform, HubSpot, Webflow) can send a notification to Slack.

If you are using a webhook to post to Slack, ensure the message contains the essential fields:
- Name
- Email / LinkedIn
- Company
- Job Title
- "Tell us about your needs" (The unstructured gold mine)

## Step 3: Create the Qualification Checklist

Now we need to tell Moltbot how to "think" like your best Sales Development Rep (SDR). We do this by configuring the system prompt or a specific "Skill."

You want Openclaw to evaluate leads based on your specific criteria. Create a qualification checklist in your configuration:

*   **Company Size:** Is the prospect > 50 employees?
*   **Use Case:** Does their problem align with our core solution?
*   **Timeline:** Are they looking to implement in the next 3 months?
*   **Budget:** Do they mention any constraints or enterprise requirements?

## Step 4: Configure a CRM Skill/Webhook

This is where the magic happens. Openclaw can use "tools" or "skills." We want to create a skill that takes the summarized lead info and sends it to your CRM (HubSpot, Salesforce, Pipedrive).

In your Openclaw configuration, you can define a tool call. For example, if you're using a webhook-based CRM update:

```json
{
  "skill": "update_crm",
  "description": "Pushes qualified lead data and summaries to the CRM",
  "parameters": {
    "lead_name": "string",
    "qualification_score": "integer",
    "summary": "string",
    "action_item": "string"
  }
}
```

When the AI identifies a high-quality lead, it will trigger this tool, sending a clean POST request to your CRM's API or a middleware like Make.com/Zapier to handle the final insertion.

## Step 5: Validation and Health Check

Before letting Clawdbot loose on live traffic, run a health check to ensure the gateway is communicating with your LLM provider (like Claude 3.5 Sonnet or GPT-4o) and your messaging platform.

```bash
clawdbot health
```

If everything looks green, start the gateway:

```bash
clawdbot gateway --port 18789 --verbose
```

Test the workflow by posting a "fake" lead into the Slack channel. You should see Openclaw reply with a summary and a confirmation that the CRM has been updated.

## Technical Deep Dive: The Commands You Need

As you scale your Sales Ops automation, you’ll need to manage the Moltbot instance effectively. Here are the core commands you should keep in your cheat sheet:

| Command | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `clawdbot onboard` | Reconfigure platforms or LLM API keys |
| `clawdbot gateway` | Starts the AI assistant engine |
| `clawdbot health` | Checks connectivity to Slack/Discord and APIs |
| `clawdbot skills list` | Views all active automation tools |

### Security Best Practices

Because you are handling lead data and CRM access, security is non-negotiable. 

1.  **Loopback Binding:** By default, bind the gateway to the loopback interface to prevent external parties from hitting your AI endpoint.
2.  **Authentication:** Configure `gateway.auth.password` in your config file to ensure only authorized services can trigger your bot.
3.  **Pairing Mode:** Set your DM policy to "pairing" mode. This ensures that even if someone finds your bot, you have to manually approve the device before it can access your sales data.
4.  **Sandbox Tools:** If you are using the bot in a large group chat, ensure that destructive tools (like "Delete Lead") are sandboxed or require admin approval.

## The Result: Pipeline Hygiene on Autopilot

By implementing Openclaw for Sales Ops, you solve the three biggest problems in the sales funnel:

1.  **Speed to Lead:** Leads are qualified in seconds, not hours.
2.  **Data Quality:** CRM notes are structured, searchable, and consistent because an AI wrote them based on a template, not a tired rep.
3.  **Rep Focus:** Your sales team stops doing data entry and starts doing what they do best: closing deals.

**Congratulations!** You now have a self-hosted, private AI agent managing your inbound pipeline. You’ve moved beyond simple "chat" and into the world of agentic automation.
