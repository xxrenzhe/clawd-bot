**My Plan for Crafting a Guide to Local LLMs with Moltbot**

Okay, so I'm putting together a comprehensive guide for beginners on running Local LLMs, specifically focusing on Moltbot (which can also be referred to as Clawdbot or Openclaw – need to make sure that's super clear throughout). The core idea is to show people how to take control of their AI, prioritizing privacy and offering a genuinely usable alternative to cloud-based solutions. I'm aiming for a word count between 1500 and 2500, but I'll make sure it's as useful and concise as possible. The publication date will be February 1st, 2026.

I’m structuring this as: frontmatter, intro, a CTA, detailed content, another CTA, conclusion, and a final CTA. The title is set: "Running Local LLMs with Moltbot: Ollama and Open Source Models," and the description clearly lays out the value proposition: private AI at home using Llama 3, Mistral, and other local models, via Ollama and Moltbot.

I need to nail the introduction. The hook will be a strong statement about privacy – “Privacy is the ultimate luxury in the age of AI.” We'll explain the shift toward local LLMs. Then, I will drop a CTA to get users onboard quickly with initial setup instructions.

I’m breaking down the content methodically. Section 1 will delve into the *Why* of local LLMs: privacy/security, no token fees saving money, customization capabilities, and the inherent offline capability. Section 2 is dedicated to Moltbot itself, also known as Clawdbot or Openclaw. I’ll define it as the AI gateway, its unified interface, and its integrations with messaging platforms like Telegram and Discord. This will be critical to explaining how it works.

Section 3 will cover the prerequisites: hardware (RAM and GPU – I *must* specify the minimums), the need for Ollama, and Moltbot installation. Section 4 walks through the Moltbot installation: I'll include the `curl` command and the `clawdbot onboard` command, making them easy to copy and paste.

Section 5 will tackle Ollama setup: download, pulling models (Llama 3, Mistral, Phi-3), and verifying the endpoint at `http://localhost:11434`. This will be crucial. Section 6 focuses on configuring Moltbot for local models, editing the config file to connect the Ollama adapter, and switching between models using the gateway. There will be another CTA here.

Section 7 is all about advanced configuration and security. I'll need to emphasize that the `gateway.bind` must be set to "loopback," to include a password, and the use of trusted proxies. I'll also describe pairing mode. Section 8 will offer real-world use cases: private document analysis, home automation (via Moltbot skills), and coding assistance.

Section 9 will provide troubleshooting tips: using `clawdbot health`, addressing latency issues, and handling memory allocation problems.

Finally, the conclusion will reiterate the value proposition of local AI. I'll also offer a free installation service, which is a key closing CTA. I'll also triple-check the word count, ensure all keywords are integrated seamlessly, and meticulously verify every command I include. The formatting has to be perfect.

*(Self-Correction during drafting):* I really need to drill down on the name flexibility (Clawdbot/Moltbot/Openclaw) so people don't get lost in the terminology. I also need to find a balance between providing technical details and being accessible for beginners. I’ll need to explicitly guide them through editing the `config.yaml` or using the CLI. I’ll provide specific hardware guidance (e.g., 8GB RAM for 7B models, 16GB+ for 13B+ models). And I need to *clearly* explain how Moltbot is the "Gateway" between Telegram and the local PC. I want this guide to be the definitive resource for beginners to start running their own local LLMs and truly owning their AI. I will also incorporate command examples such as `clawdbot gateway --port 18789 --verbose`, to improve usability.
