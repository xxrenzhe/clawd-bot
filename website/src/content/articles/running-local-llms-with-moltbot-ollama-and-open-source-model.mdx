# Running Local LLMs with Moltbot, Ollama, and Open Models

![Running local LLMs with Moltbot and Ollama](/images/articles/running-local-llms-with-moltbot-ollama-and-open-source-model.jpg)

## Introduction

Local LLMs are a great fit when you want predictable costs and stronger data privacy. Moltbot (Clawdbot/Openclaw) supports local inference so you can run workflows without sending every request to a hosted API. This is especially useful for routine automation: summaries, checklists, and formatting tasks that do not require the strongest model available.

This guide shows how to combine Moltbot with a local model workflow and when it makes sense to use a hybrid approach.

## When local LLMs make sense

Use local models when:

- You have stable, repeatable tasks
- You want predictable monthly costs
- You need tighter data control
- You are comfortable trading a bit of accuracy for privacy

For high-stakes tasks (legal, finance, critical decisions), you may still choose a hosted model. The best setup is usually hybrid: local models for volume, premium models for accuracy.

## Quick setup (verified commands)

Start with a working Moltbot gateway:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://clawd.bot/install.sh | bash
clawdbot onboard
clawdbot health
clawdbot gateway --port 18789 --verbose
```

## Example local model workflow

Local models are great for low-risk automation. Examples:

- Daily summaries of notes
- Formatting or cleanup tasks
- Simple classification and tagging

If you want to try a local model, follow the official Ollama documentation for installation. A typical workflow looks like this:

```bash
# Example commands for local models
ollama pull llama3
ollama run llama3
```

Then route low-risk tasks to the local model and reserve premium APIs for the tasks that need it.

## Performance and hardware tips

Local inference is sensitive to hardware. To keep the experience smooth:

- Use 8GB+ RAM for basic models
- Prefer SSD storage for faster load times
- Batch tasks when possible
- Keep prompts short and structured

If the model struggles, try smaller variants or reduce the context length.

## Model selection guide

Not every model is a good fit for local automation. Use these guidelines:

- **Smaller models** for summaries, classification, and formatting.
- **Larger models** for reasoning-heavy tasks or long context.
- **Quantized models** when you need speed on limited hardware.

If output quality is inconsistent, start with a smaller scope and add validation steps. A reliable small model often beats a flaky larger one.

## Quality guardrails for local workflows

Local models are more likely to drift when prompts are vague. Keep them consistent by:\n\n- Defining strict output formats (tables or bullet lists)\n- Providing a short example input and output\n- Limiting context to only what matters\n\nThese guardrails keep your automation stable even as you scale volume.

## Security and privacy defaults

A local model reduces data exposure, but you still need good security:

- Bind the gateway to loopback
- Use pairing for messaging integrations
- Store keys and tokens in secrets

See [security best practices](/articles/clawdbot-security-best-practices) for a full checklist.

## Hybrid routing strategy

Many teams use a hybrid approach to keep both quality and cost under control:

- Route summaries, tagging, and formatting to local models.
- Route complex reasoning or high-stakes decisions to hosted models.
- Keep a fallback path so critical workflows never fail.

This balance gives you predictable cost without sacrificing reliability.

If you are unsure which tasks to route locally, start with summaries and formatting. These tasks are easy to verify and rarely require advanced reasoning.

## Performance troubleshooting

If local inference is slow, try these fixes:

- Reduce context length and remove unnecessary inputs.
- Switch to a smaller model for routine tasks.
- Batch requests during low-traffic windows.

Local workflows are reliable once tuned, but they benefit from simple performance guardrails.

## Cost and resource planning

Local models shift costs from tokens to hardware. Track CPU, memory, and storage usage so you can predict when to scale up. If you notice frequent slowdowns, consider batching workloads or reserving a larger instance for peak hours. These small adjustments often deliver a better experience than switching models repeatedly.

## Conclusion

Local LLMs are a practical way to keep costs stable and improve privacy for routine automation. Start small, validate output quality, and expand only after the workflow feels reliable. Moltbot gives you the flexibility to choose the right model for each task.
