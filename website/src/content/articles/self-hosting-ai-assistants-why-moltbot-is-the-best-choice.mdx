# Self-Hosting AI Assistants: Why Moltbot is the Best Choice

![Self-Hosting AI Assistants: Why Moltbot is the Best Choice](/images/articles/self-hosting-ai-assistants-why-moltbot-is-the-best-choice.jpg)

## Introduction

Self-hosting is the fastest way to regain control of your AI assistant. It gives you ownership of data, predictable costs, and the freedom to choose models. Moltbot (also known as Clawdbot or Openclaw) is built for self-hosting with a gateway architecture that keeps integrations, memory, and tools in one reliable place.

This guide explains why self-hosting matters and how to deploy Moltbot securely.

<HostingCTA context="setup" />

## Why self-hosting matters

Teams self-host for four reasons:

- **Privacy**: keep sensitive data on infrastructure you control.
- **Cost**: avoid unpredictable usage bills.
- **Flexibility**: switch models without vendor lock-in.
- **Auditability**: log and review every action.

If your assistant handles internal knowledge or customer data, these are critical.

## Moltbot architecture for private assistants

Moltbot separates the gateway from the assistant. The gateway manages:

- Messaging integrations
- Retrieval and memory
- Tools and skills

This makes self-hosted operations easier to maintain and safer to scale.

## Installation and first run

Install and onboard:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://clawd.bot/install.sh | bash
clawdbot onboard
clawdbot health
```

Start the gateway:

```bash
clawdbot gateway --port 18789 --verbose
```

For a full walkthrough, see [getting started](/articles/getting-started-with-moltbot-beginner-friendly-tutorial).

## Deployment options

You can deploy Moltbot to:

- A local machine for personal use
- A VPS for 24/7 access
- Docker or Kubernetes for teams

- [VPS deployment](/articles/clawdbot-vps-deployment)

## Hardware sizing basics

Sizing depends on model choice and traffic:

- **Personal use**: 2-4 CPU cores and 4-8 GB RAM
- **Team use**: 4-8 CPU cores and 8-16 GB RAM
- **Local models**: GPU or higher RAM for larger models

Start small and scale after you measure real usage.

## Security and hardening

Self-hosting works when the security baseline is clear:

- Bind the gateway to loopback or a private network.
- Use pairing mode for external channels.
- Store credentials in environment variables.
- Rotate keys regularly and audit logs.

Use [Clawdbot security best practices](/articles/clawdbot-security-best-practices) for a full checklist.

## Operations and reliability

For production use, add monitoring and backups:

- Track latency and error rates
- Keep logs for tool calls and outputs
- Back up retrieval stores regularly

See [monitoring setup](/articles/clawdbot-monitoring-setup) and [logging practices](/articles/clawdbot-logging-practices).

## Network and SSL setup

If you expose the gateway outside your local machine:

- Use a reverse proxy with TLS termination
- Restrict access by IP or VPN
- Enable strong authentication for admin endpoints

See [reverse proxy setup](/articles/clawdbot-reverse-proxy) and [SSL setup](/articles/clawdbot-ssl-setup).

## Upgrade and rollback plan

Keep upgrades safe with a simple plan:

- Back up configs and vector stores
- Test upgrades in a staging environment
- Roll back if latency or errors spike

Small, frequent upgrades are easier to validate than large jumps.

## Operational checklist

Before you call a deployment production-ready:

- Monitoring dashboards are live
- Backup schedules are automated
- Admin access is documented and limited
- Incident response steps are written

This checklist keeps self-hosted assistants stable under real usage.

## Backup and recovery

Backups should cover:

- Gateway configuration files
- Vector stores and memory indexes
- Environment secrets (stored securely)

Test recovery at least once. A backup that has never been restored is not a real backup.

## Maintenance cadence

Set a simple maintenance schedule:

- Weekly: review logs and error rates
- Monthly: update dependencies and rotate secrets
- Quarterly: test restores and disaster recovery

Regular maintenance keeps self-hosted systems stable and secure.

## When to move from local to server

Start locally, then move to a server when:

- You need 24/7 availability
- Multiple users rely on the assistant
- Local hardware becomes a bottleneck

This staged approach keeps costs low while you validate value.

## Support and escalation

Even self-hosted systems need support plans:

- Define who responds to alerts
- Keep a simple runbook for common issues
- Escalate to infrastructure support when needed

Clear ownership reduces downtime and improves user trust.
A simple on-call rotation is often enough for small teams.

## Compliance considerations

If you operate under compliance rules:

- Document data retention policies
- Keep audit logs for tool calls and outputs
- Separate sensitive datasets by collection

Moltbot makes this easier because you control the infrastructure end to end.

## Data residency advantage

Self-hosting lets you choose where data lives. This is useful for teams with regional data requirements or strict audit needs. When the gateway and storage stay in your environment, you can align the assistant with existing security policies instead of bending policy to fit a vendor.

## Cost control and model strategy

Self-hosting lets you mix hosted and local models. A simple strategy:

- Use hosted models for critical tasks.
- Use local models for batch or low-risk work.
- Route tasks based on complexity.

For a deeper model comparison, read [LLM providers for Moltbot](/articles/comparing-llm-providers-for-moltbot-claude-gpt-4-and-more).

To keep costs predictable, set monthly budgets and review usage. If a workflow exceeds its budget, reduce context size, tighten retrieval, or move it to a smaller model.
Small reductions in context size often save the most.
Review budgets monthly and tag each workflow with an owner responsible for cost. This keeps spending aligned with value.
Plan capacity reviews quarterly and retire unused workflows.
Document internal SLAs and review them annually.
Keep the schedule simple so it actually happens. Consistency matters more than perfection.
Keep notes.
Document it.

## Free installation service

We offer a free Moltbot installation service. Get started at [Contact](/contact).

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| Node.js | 22+ (check: node --version) |
| OS | macOS, Linux, Windows (via WSL2) |
| Memory | 2GB RAM minimum (4GB+ recommended for browser automation) |
| Storage | 500MB for installation |

If you are already running Moltbot, you can skip installation and focus on configuration and workflows.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|---|---|
| Command not found | Ensure Node.js 22+ is installed and your PATH is updated. |
| Gateway not reachable | Confirm the gateway is bound to loopback and port 18789 is free. |
| Auth errors | Verify API keys and rotate them if they may be exposed. |
| Slow responses | Reduce active skills, test a smaller model, and review logs. |
| Messages not delivered | Re-check channel tokens and allow-lists. |

## Conclusion

Self-hosting is the best way to build a private, reliable AI assistant. Moltbot gives you the architecture to run assistants with strong security, flexible models, and predictable operations. Start small, prove stability, and scale with confidence.

## Additional Notes

Moltbot workflows work best when you keep inputs tight and outputs measurable.
Define success criteria for self-hosting ai assistants: why moltbot is the best choice before you automate anything significant.

For teams, document configuration changes and run clawdbot doctor after major edits.
This keeps the gateway stable and reduces debugging time when scaling up.

Key reminders:
- Keep tokens and passwords out of version control.
- Validate the gateway locally before exposing it.
- Roll out new skills in small batches and monitor logs.
- Re-check allow-lists after any channel changes.
