# Moltbot Beginner's Guide: From Zero to AI Assistant

![Moltbot beginner's guide](/images/articles/setup-clawdbot-beginners.jpg)

## What is Moltbot?

Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot) is a free, open-source AI assistant that:
- Connects to Claude, GPT-4, or other LLMs
- Works via Telegram, Discord, WhatsApp, or terminal
- Runs on your computer or server (your data stays private)
- Has 565+ automation skills (email, calendar, smart home, code)

Think of it as ChatGPT that you own and control.

## What You'll Need

| Requirement | Notes |
|-------------|-------|
| Computer | Mac, Linux, or Windows with WSL2 |
| 10 minutes | Actual setup time |
| Claude API key | Free tier available at console.anthropic.com |
| Telegram (optional) | For messaging your AI from your phone |

## Step 1: Install Node.js

Moltbot needs Node.js 22 or higher.

**Mac:**
```bash
brew install node@22
```

**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_22.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

**Windows:**
Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) (use WSL2 for best experience).

**Verify:**
```bash
node --version  # Should show v22.x or higher
```

## Step 2: Install Moltbot

```bash
curl -fsSL https://molt.bot/install.sh | bash
```

Or with npm:
```bash
npm install -g moltbot
```

Verify it worked:
```bash
moltbot --version
```

## Step 3: Get Your API Key

1. Go to [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com)
2. Create an account (free)
3. Click "API Keys" → "Create Key"
4. Copy your key (starts with `sk-ant-`)

<HostingCTA context="inline" />

## Step 4: Run Setup Wizard

```bash
moltbot onboard
```

The wizard will ask for:
- Your API key (paste it)
- Which messaging apps to connect (optional)

## Step 5: Test It Works

```bash
moltbot health
```

You should see:
```
✓ Gateway healthy
✓ Claude API connected
✓ Config valid
```

Now try chatting:
```bash
moltbot chat
```

Type a message and press Enter. You're talking to Claude!

## Optional: Connect Telegram

This lets you message your AI from your phone.

**1. Create a Telegram bot:**
- Open Telegram, search for `@BotFather`
- Send `/newbot`
- Choose a name (e.g., "My AI Assistant")
- Choose a username (must end in `bot`, e.g., `myaibot`)
- Copy the token BotFather gives you

**2. Add it to Moltbot:**
```bash
moltbot configure --section channels.telegram
```
Paste your bot token when prompted.

**3. Start the gateway:**
```bash
moltbot gateway
```

**4. Test it:**
Open Telegram, find your bot, and send a message!

## What Can Moltbot Do?

### Basic Chat
```
You: What's the weather like today?
Moltbot: I don't have real-time weather access by default.
         Want me to add the weather skill?
```

### With Skills
```bash
moltbot skill add weather
moltbot skill add web-search
moltbot skill add email
```

Now:
```
You: What's the weather in Tokyo?
Moltbot: Currently 18°C in Tokyo, partly cloudy...
```

### Automation Examples
- "Summarize my unread emails"
- "Add a meeting to my calendar for tomorrow at 2pm"
- "Turn off the living room lights" (with smart home skill)
- "Create a GitHub issue for the login bug"

## Common Questions

### How much does it cost?
- Moltbot: Free (open source)
- Claude API: ~$0.01-0.03 per conversation (varies by length)
- Typical monthly cost: $5-20 for personal use

### Is my data private?
Yes. Moltbot runs on your computer. Conversations go to Claude's API but aren't stored by Anthropic for training (with API access).

### Can I use GPT-4 instead of Claude?
Yes! During `moltbot onboard`, choose OpenAI instead. You can also use local models like Llama.

### How do I update?
```bash
npm update -g moltbot
```

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| `command not found` | Restart your terminal |
| `API key invalid` | Double-check at console.anthropic.com |
| `Port in use` | Run `lsof -i :18789` to find conflicts |
| `Node version too old` | Install Node.js 22+ |

2. **Connect more apps**: Discord, Slack, WhatsApp
3. **Run 24/7**: Set up on a Mac Mini or VPS
4. **Explore**: Ask your AI what it can help with!

## Additional Notes

Moltbot workflows work best when you keep inputs tight and outputs measurable.
Define success criteria for moltbot beginner's guide: from zero to ai assistant before you automate anything significant.

For teams, document configuration changes and run clawdbot doctor after major edits.
This keeps the gateway stable and reduces debugging time when scaling up.

Key reminders:
- Keep tokens and passwords out of version control.
- Validate the gateway locally before exposing it.
- Roll out new skills in small batches and monitor logs.
- Re-check allow-lists after any channel changes.
